3: Entering and Exiting Underground Parking Lots at Low Speed: For various reasons, when driving in and out of underground parking lots or navigating within them, it's essential to maintain a defensive mindset. The entrance passage of an underground parking lot typically has a steep ramp. When descending this steep slope to enter the parking area, if the vehicle's speed has not been reduced in advance, gravity can cause the vehicle to accelerate, creating a potential hazard due to excessive speed. The road network in underground parking lots is often intricate and crisscrossed. Once a vehicle enters the parking area, the driver must pay attention to the directional arrows on the ground and the signs overhead, look for a suitable parking spot, yield to vehicles entering or exiting parking spaces, and watch out for pedestrians heading towards elevators. In such a complex environment, the driver must maintain focused attention and manage it wisely. To achieve this, it is crucial to reduce speed, allowing ample time to make decisions and react accordingly. When exiting an underground parking lot, there are often numerous curves, creating frequent blind spots. Before reaching the parking lot exit, the vehicle typically ascends a steep slope, making it difficult to observe the road conditions and increasing the challenge of vehicle control. At the parking lot exit, the vehicle may need to stop for license plate recognition or to pay parking fees, so the driver must be prepared to reduce speed and come to a complete stop if necessary.
### Original Function Call:
Function(
  arguments='{"trigger":{"in":"tunnel"},"condition":{"vehicle_state":{"speed":{"CompOp":"<","speed_num":10}}},"action":{"Whether_declearation":true,"Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio":0.2}}',
  name='UDrive'
)

### Revised Function Call:
Function(
  name='UDrive',
  arguments='{
    "trigger": {
      "in": "steep_slope"
    },
    "condition": {
      "vehicle_state": {
        "speed": {
          "CompOp": ">",
          "speed_num": 10
        }
      }
    },
    "action": {
      "Expected_speed": {
        "speed_number": 10
      }
    }
  }'
)

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Changed trigger from `"in": "tunnel"` to `"in": "steep_slope"`:  
  The entrance/exit ramps of underground parking lots are characterized by steep slopes rather than tunnels.  
- Inverted the speed condition to `"speed": { "CompOp": ">", "speed_num": 10 }`:  
  We want to detect when the vehicle is traveling faster than the safe threshold (10 km/h) so that corrective action can be taken.  
- Replaced the ad-hoc obstacle deceleration parameters with an explicit `"Expected_speed": { "speed_number": 10 }`:  
  Parking‐lot driving requires maintaining a low, controlled speed. Using `Expected_speed` enforces a maximum speed directly, rather than tying deceleration to an (absent) obstacle.  
- Removed `"Whether_declearation"` and `"Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio"`:  
  Those parameters only apply when reacting to a detected obstacle; here the goal is general speed control on a slope.
4: Overtaking Restrictions: Defensive driving emphasizes the importance of proper overtaking rules. The basic rule for overtaking is to pass the vehicle in front from the left side, not from the right side. Many traffic accidents are caused by improper overtaking. So, in which situations is overtaking not advisable? 1. Do Not Overtake a Vehicle with the Left Turn Signal On: When the vehicle in front has its left turn signal on, the following vehicle should not attempt to overtake. Doing so could lead to a collision as the front vehicle might turn left at any moment. 2. Avoid Overtaking in Complex Situations: Do not overtake in areas where traffic conditions are complex, such as intersections, curves, tunnels, pedestrian crossings, railroad crossings, narrow bridges, and busy urban streets. Overtaking in such places increases the risk of accidents. When driving on steep roads, pay close attention to the traffic markings. Visibility is often limited on uphill sections, making it difficult to see oncoming traffic. Always stay to the right side of the road and do not cross the centerline to overtake, as this could result in a head-on collision. 3. Do Not Overtake Vehicles on Emergency Duty: It is important not to overtake vehicles on emergency duty, such as police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, and emergency repair vehicles. These vehicles need to reach their destinations as quickly as possible, and they are often already traveling at high speeds. Attempting to overtake them could lead to speeding violations and increased risk of accidents.
### Analysis of Provided UDrive Calls

Below we examine each of the nine calls for semantic/practical validity against the “overtaking-restrictions” description.  Where a call is invalid or incomplete, we provide a corrected version plus the necessary modifications and reasons.

---

1)  
Original Function Call:  
```python
Function(
  name='UDrive',
  arguments='{
    "condition": {
      "find_signal": {"signal_type": "railway_crossing"}
    },
    "trigger": {"always": true},
    "action": {"Whether_priority_change_lane": false}
  }'
)
```

Revised Function Call:  
```python
Function(
  name='UDrive',
  arguments='{
    "trigger": {"in": "railway_crossing"},
    "action": {
      "Whether_allow_left_lane_change": false,
      "Whether_allow_borrow_left_lane": false
    }
  }'
)
```

Modifications and Reasons:  
- Changed `"condition":{"find_signal":…}` → `"trigger":{"in":"railway_crossing"}`  
  • “railway_crossing” is a road‐type trigger, not a traffic‐signal.  
- Replaced `"Whether_priority_change_lane":false` with  
  - `"Whether_allow_left_lane_change":false`  
  - `"Whether_allow_borrow_left_lane":false`  
  • To actually forbid overtaking on the left, disable left‐lane changes and left‐lane borrowing rather than just de-prioritizing.

---

2)  
Original Function Call:  
```python
Function(
  name='UDrive',
  arguments='{
    "trigger": {"always": true},
    "condition": {"is_jam": true},
    "action": {"Whether_priority_change_lane": false}
  }'
)
```

Revised Function Call:  
```python
Function(
  name='UDrive',
  arguments='{
    "trigger": {"always": true},
    "condition": {"is_jam": true},
    "action": {
      "Whether_allow_left_lane_change": false,
      "Whether_allow_borrow_left_lane": false
    }
  }'
)
```

Modifications and Reasons:  
- Replaced `"Whether_priority_change_lane":false` with the pair of flags that actually forbid left‐side overtaking.  
- Retained `is_jam:true` as a proxy for “complex/busy traffic” where overtaking is not advisable.

---

3)  
Original Function Call:  
```python
Function(
  name='UDrive',
  arguments='{
    "trigger": {"always": true},
    "condition": {
      "find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "front"},
      "vehicle_state": {"state": "left_turn_light"}
    },
    "action": {"Whether_priority_change_lane": false}
  }'
)
```

Issue & Recommendation:  
- UDrive’s `find_obstacle` cannot inspect a *leading* vehicle’s turn signal, and `vehicle_state.state` refers only to the *ego* vehicle’s lights/horn.  
- **Invalid** under the existing DSL.  

Proposed resolutions:  
1) **Extend** `find_obstacle` schema to include e.g.  
   ```json
   "find_obstacle": {
     "obstacle_type": "vehicle",
     "position": "front",
     "turn_signal": "left"
   }
   ```  
2) Once extended, you could write:  
   ```python
   Function(name='UDrive', arguments='{
     "trigger": {"always": true},
     "condition": {
       "find_obstacle": {
         "obstacle_type": "vehicle",
         "position": "front",
         "turn_signal": "left"
       }
     },
     "action": {
       "Whether_allow_left_lane_change": false,
       "Whether_allow_borrow_left_lane": false
     }
   }')
   ```

    "trigger": {"in": "intersection"},
    "action": {"Whether_priority_change_lane": false}
  }'

```

Revised Function Call:  
```python
Function(
  name='UDrive',
  arguments='{
    "trigger": {"in": "intersection"},
    "action": {
      "Whether_allow_left_lane_change": false,
      "Whether_allow_borrow_left_lane": false

    }
  }'
)
```

Modifications and Reasons:  
- Same update to action flags.

7)  
Original Function Call:  
```python
Function(
  name='UDrive',
  arguments='{

      "Whether_allow_borrow_left_lane": false
    }
  }'
)
```

Modifications and Reasons:  
- Consistent with rule against overtaking at railroad crossings.  
- Updated to proper “forbid left‐lane change” flags.

Modifications and Reasons:  
- Same update to action flags.

### Summary of Key Corrections
- **Use “trigger.in”** for fixed roadside environments (intersection, tunnel, railway_crossing, etc.), not `find_signal`.
- **Disable left‐side overtaking** by setting both  
  • `Whether_allow_left_lane_change: false`  
  • `Whether_allow_borrow_left_lane: false`  
  rather than merely de-prioritizing lane changes.
- **Detecting a preceding vehicle’s turn‐signal** requires an extension to `find_obstacle`.
6: Respecting Public Buses and School Buses: 1.Do Not Follow Too Closely Behind Buses: When approaching intersections with traffic signals, following a large bus too closely can lead to accidentally running a red light or ignoring a no-entry sign due to obscured visibility. 2.Be Cautious Near Bus Stops: In areas with bus stops, non-motorized vehicles may enter the motor vehicle lane to bypass the bus, and passengers getting on or off the bus might cross the road. Motor vehicles passing through these areas should proceed with caution, slow down, and yield to non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians. If the bus is blocking the lane and prevents you from passing, you should stop and wait until it is safe to proceed. 3.Yield to School Buses: When a school bus is picking up or dropping off students, it will activate its hazard lights and extend the stop sign, stopping on the right side of the road. If the school bus is stopped on a road with only one lane in each direction, vehicles behind it must stop and wait, and are not allowed to overtake. If the bus is stopped on a road with two or more lanes in each direction, vehicles in the same lane as the bus, as well as those in the adjacent lane, must stop and wait. Vehicles in other lanes should slow down and pass with caution.
### Original Function Call:
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"always": true},  
  "condition": {  
    "find_obstacle": {  
      "obstacle_type": "vehicle",  
      "position": "front",  
      "distance": {"CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 20},  
      "speed": {"CompOp": "<", "speed_num": 30}  
    },  
    "find_signal": {"signal_type": "yield_signal", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 30}  
  },  
  "action": {"Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance": 30}  
}', name='UDrive')

### Analysis of Issues
1. “obstacle_type”:**vehicle** does not distinguish buses from other vehicles. We need bus-specific behavior.  
2. “find_signal”→**yield_signal** is unrelated to buses; bus stops do not emit “yield” signals.  
3. The natural-language rules actually require three distinct behaviors:  
   a. Stay well back when following a bus at a signalized intersection.  
   b. Approach bus stops with caution and stop if the bus blocks the lane.  
   c. Stop for a school bus with hazard lights and stop-sign extended, with different lane rules depending on road width.  
4. The single rule above conflates “following too close” with “yield signal ahead” and uses a follow distance of only 30 m, which is too small for large buses.

### Revised Function Calls
Below we define three separate UDrive rules to cover the three bullet-points:

1. **Do Not Follow Too Closely Behind Buses at Intersections**  
```json
{
  "trigger":     { "always": true },
  "condition": {
    "in": "intersection",
    "find_obstacle": {
      "obstacle_type": "bus",                     ← bus subtype required
      "position":      "front",
      "distance":      { "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 20 }
    }
  },
  "action": {
    "Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance": 50       ← larger buffer for visibility
  }
}
```

2. **Be Cautious Near Bus Stops; Stop If the Bus Blocks the Lane**  
```json
{
  "trigger":     { "always": true },
  "condition": {
    "in": "urban_lane",
    "find_obstacle": {
      "obstacle_type": "bus",
      "position":      "front",
      "speed":         { "CompOp": "==", "speed_num": 0 }
    }
  },
  "action": {
    "Mano_action":                "stop",
    "Whether_declearation":       true,
    "Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio": 1.0  ← full stop
  }
}
```

3. **Yield to School Buses with Hazard Lights and Stop-Sign Extended**  
```json
{
  "trigger":     { "always": true },
  "condition": {
    "find_obstacle": {
      "obstacle_type": "school_bus",             ← distinct subtype
      "position":      "front",
      "speed":         { "CompOp": "==", "speed_num": 0 }
    }
  },
  "action": {
    "Mano_action":                "stop",
    "Whether_declearation":       true,
    "Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio": 1.0
  }
}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Added “bus” / “school_bus” as obstacle_type**  
  The DSL must be extended to distinguish buses and school buses from generic vehicles.  
- **Split into three rules**  
  The natural-language description defines three distinct scenarios with different behaviors.  
- **Removed irrelevant “find_signal”: “yield_signal”**  
  Bus rules are based on obstacle detection and bus-specific signals (hazard lights / stop-sign), not yield signals.  
- **Increased follow distance at intersections**  
  A 50 m buffer behind a bus provides safer visibility through the intersection.  
- **Stop when bus blocks the lane**  
  Condition on bus speed == 0 and action Mano_action=“stop” ensures the vehicle will wait rather than illegally passing.  
- **Dedicated school_bus rule**  
  School buses display hazard lights and extend a stop sign; we must stop for them regardless of lane count.  

With these changes, the UDrive rules now faithfully implement the three “Respect Public and School Bus” directives.
7: Navigating Signal-Controlled Intersections: 1.Slow Down and Choose the Correct Lane: Before approaching a signalized intersection, you should start easing off the accelerator pedal 30 to 100 meters before the intersection, allowing the vehicle to decelerate smoothly. If driving on a road with two or more lanes in the same direction, pay attention to the directional arrows marked on the pavement and the lane direction signs suspended above the road to ensure you are in the correct lane for your intended route. Entering the Intersection: First-Come, First-Served: The first cycle of the green light at an intersection is referred to as the 'first green', while the second cycle is called the 'second green'. The principle of allowing vehicles from the first green light to proceed before those from the second green light is essential for maintaining order at the intersection and is also a key factor in determining liability in traffic accidents. Extending this principle, if vehicles that entered the intersection during the previous green light have not yet cleared the intersection, vehicles from the subsequent green light cycle should not enter the intersection until it is clear.
### Original Function Call:

  arguments='{"trigger": {"in": "intersection"},  
                "condition": {"find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle",

                                               "direction": "same",  
                                               "distance": {"CompOp": "==", "distance_num": 0}}},  
                "action": {"Mano_action": "wait"}}',  
  name='UDrive'
)

### Revised Function Call:
Function(
  arguments='{
    "trigger": {"always": true},
    "condition": {
      "distance_to": {
        "road_type": "intersection",
        "CompOp": "<=",

      "Expected_speed": {
        "speed_number": 30
      }
    }
  }',
  name='UDrive'
)

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Changed trigger from `{"in": "intersection"}` to `{"always": true}` with a distance‐based condition.  
  • “in: intersection” fires only once the vehicle has entered the intersection, whereas the requirement is to **start decelerating 30–100 m before** reaching it.  
- Replaced the single `find_obstacle` check at zero distance (which is semantically “bumper-to-bumper”) with **two `distance_to` constraints**:  
  • `<= 100 m` and `>= 30 m` to bracket the approach zone.  
- Swapped `Mano_action: "wait"` (a full stop) for an **`Expected_speed`** constraint of 30 km/h to represent **smooth deceleration** rather than stopping dead when an obstacle is detected.  
- By specifying a target speed, the ego vehicle will ease off the accelerator and settle at a lower speed in the 30–100 m approach band, satisfying “start easing off 30 to 100 m before the intersection.”
8: Navigating Unsignalized Intersections: 1. Right Turn Path at Intersections: When making a right turn at an intersection, the driver should be vigilant for oncoming traffic from the left. Only when it is safe to do so should the vehicle make the turn, staying close to the right side of the road. This approach minimizes the risk of interference with vehicles approaching from the side. 2. Left Turn Path at Intersections: At intersections marked with a center circle, vehicles making a left turn should keep close to the left side of the center circle while turning. At intersections without a marked center circle, vehicles should take a wide left turn, following a path that stays slightly to the right within the intersection. This approach helps ensure a safe and smooth turn. 3. Right of Way for Straight-Through Vehicles: At intersections without traffic signals, signs, or markings, when vehicles from different directions meet, the vehicle on the left must yield to the vehicle approaching from the right. This rule ensures safe passage through the intersection. 4. Right of Way Between Turning and Straight-Through Vehicles: At intersections without traffic signals, signs, or markings, when vehicles from different directions meet, vehicles making a right or left turn must yield to vehicles going straight through the intersection. This ensures that straight-through vehicles have the right of way, reducing the risk of accidents. 5. Right of Way Between Left-Turning and Right-Turning Vehicles: At intersections without traffic signals, vehicles turning right must yield to vehicles turning left from the opposite direction, including motor vehicles and non-motorized vehicles. This rule also applies to intersections controlled by red, yellow, and green traffic lights. This ensures that left-turning vehicles have the priority to pass through the intersection safely. 6. Right-of-Way Between Vehicles on the Right and the Main Road: According to Article 52, Item 2 of the `Regulations for the Implementation of the Road Traffic Safety Law', when a motor vehicle approaches an intersection without traffic signals, police direction, or control signs/markings, the driver must stop and yield to vehicles coming from the right before entering the intersection. The principle of 'yielding to vehicles from the right' can be broken down into three scenarios: 1) Right Lane Vehicle Going Straight, Main Road Vehicle Going Straight or Turning: The vehicle on the main road must yield to the vehicle on the right lane. 2) Both Vehicles Turning: If both the vehicle on the right lane and the vehicle on the main road are turning, the vehicle on the main road must yield to the vehicle on the right lane. 3) Right Lane Vehicle Turning, Main Road Vehicle Going Straight: In this case, the right lane vehicle must yield to the vehicle on the main road going straight. 7. Roundabout Traffic Rules: Vehicles preparing to enter a roundabout must yield to those already circulating within the roundabout. When entering the roundabout, drivers should not use their turn signals. However, when exiting the roundabout, drivers must activate their right turn signal. Vehicles inside the roundabout must travel in a counterclockwise direction around the central island; driving clockwise to take a shortcut is prohibited.
### Analysis of Provided Function Calls

Below is a structured analysis of each of the four UDrive calls against the natural-language requirements.  For each call, we show the original, a revised version, and the key modifications with reasons.

---

### 1) Right Turn at an Unsignalized Intersection

Natural-language requirement  
“When making a right turn at an intersection, the driver should be vigilant for oncoming traffic from the left. Only when it is safe to do so should the vehicle make the turn, staying close to the right side of the road.”

Original Function Call  
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"in": "intersection"}, "condition": {"vehicle_state": {"driving_state": "turn_right"}, "find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "left", "distance": {"CompOp": ">", "distance_num": 10}}}, "action": {"Change_lane_action": {"direction": "right", "times": 1}}}', name='UDrive')

Revised Function Call  
Function(arguments='''{  
  "trigger": { "in": "intersection" },  
  "condition": {  
    "vehicle_state": { "driving_state": "turn_right" },  
    "find_obstacle": {  
      "obstacle_type": "vehicle",  
      "position": "left",  
      "direction": "opposite",  
      "distance": { "CompOp": ">", "distance_num": 10 }  
    }  
  },  
  "action": {  
    "Mano_action": "launch"  
  }  
}''', name='UDrive')

Modifications and Reasons  
- Changed action from `Change_lane_action` to `Mano_action: "launch"`  
  • Rationale: a right turn at an intersection is not a simple lane-change maneuver but the execution of the turn itself. “launch” better represents “go ahead with the turn.”  
- Added `"direction": "opposite"` under `find_obstacle`  
  • Rationale: oncoming traffic approaches from the opposite direction.  
- Removed `Change_lane_action`  
  • Rationale: DSL’s lane-change action is intended for moving between lanes on a straight roadway, not turning at an intersection.

---

### 2) Left Turn at an Unsignalized Intersection

Natural-language requirement  
“At intersections marked with a center circle, left-turning vehicles hug the left side of the circle. Without a circle, they execute a wide turn, staying slightly to the right inside the intersection.”

Original Function Call  
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"in": "intersection"}, "condition": {"vehicle_state": {"driving_state": "turn_left"}}, "action": {"Change_lane_action": {"direction": "left", "times": 1}}}', name='UDrive')

Revised Function Call  
Function(arguments='''{  
  "trigger": { "in": "intersection" },  
  "condition": {  
    "vehicle_state": { "driving_state": "turn_left" }  
  },  
  "action": {  
    "Mano_action": "launch"  
  }  
}''', name='UDrive')

Modifications and Reasons  
- Changed action to `Mano_action: "launch"`  
  • Rationale: like the right turn, a left turn at an intersection is not a lane-change; `"launch"` initiates the turning maneuver.  
- Removed `Change_lane_action`  
  • Rationale: DSL’s lane-change is not semantically aligned with intersection turning.

### 3) Yielding to Vehicles on the Right (Straight-Through Scenario)

Natural-language requirement  
“At intersections without signals or markings, vehicles on the left yield to vehicles on the right when going straight.”

Original Function Call  
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"in": "intersection"}, "condition": {"find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "right", "distance": {"CompOp": ">", "distance_num": 10}}}, "action": {"Mano_action": "yield"}}', name='UDrive')

Revised Function Call  
Function(arguments='''{  
  "trigger": { "in": "intersection" },  
  "condition": {  
    "vehicle_state": { "driving_state": "go_straight" },  
    "find_obstacle": {  
      "obstacle_type": "vehicle",  
      "position": "right",  
      "direction": "same",  
      "distance": { "CompOp": ">", "distance_num": 10 }  
    }  
  },  
  "action": {  
    "Mano_action": "yield"  
  }  
}''', name='UDrive')

Modifications and Reasons  
- Added `vehicle_state.driving_state: "go_straight"`  
  • Rationale: this rule applies specifically when the ego vehicle is proceeding straight.  
- Added `"direction": "same"` under `find_obstacle`  
  • Rationale: vehicles approaching from the right in this scenario travel in the same (perpendicular) plane, not “opposite” to the ego straight path.

### 4) Yielding at a Roundabout Entry

Natural-language requirement  
“Vehicles preparing to enter a roundabout must yield to those already circulating (coming from the left). No turn signal on entry; right turn signal only on exit.”

Original Function Call  
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"in": "roundabout"}, "condition": {"find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "right", "distance": {"CompOp": ">", "distance_num": 10}}}, "action": {"Mano_action": "yield", "State_action": {"target": "right_turn_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}', name='UDrive')

Revised Function Call  
Function(arguments='''{  
  "trigger": { "in": "roundabout" },  
  "condition": {  
    "find_obstacle": {  
      "obstacle_type": "vehicle",  
      "position": "left",  
      "direction": "same",  
      "distance": { "CompOp": "<=", "distance_num": 10 }  
    }  
  },  
  "action": {  
    "Mano_action": "yield"  
  }  
}''', name='UDrive')

Modifications and Reasons  
- Changed `position` from `"right"` to `"left"`  
  • Rationale: circulating traffic in a counterclockwise roundabout comes from the left of the entry.  
- Changed `distance` operator to `"<="` with a smaller threshold (e.g. 10 m)  
  • Rationale: you yield when another vehicle is sufficiently close, not when it is far away.  
- Removed `State_action` for the right-turn signal  
  • Rationale: no turn signal is used when entering; the right turn signal only applies on exit.

These revisions align each UDrive call with the intended semantics and practical constraints of unsignalized intersections and roundabouts.
9: Avoid Parking Violations: 1. No-Parking Zones: Parking is prohibited in areas with no-parking signs or markings, on roads where there are barriers between the motor vehicle lane and the non-motorized vehicle lane or sidewalk, and at pedestrian crossings or construction sites. 2. No Parking Within 50 Meters: Parking is prohibited within 50 meters of intersections, railroad crossings, sharp curves, roads narrower than 4 meters, bridges, steep slopes, tunnels, and the road sections within 50 meters of these locations. 3. No Parking Within 30 Meters: Parking is prohibited within 30 meters of bus stops, emergency stations, gas stations, fire hydrants, or fire station entrances, and on the road sections within 30 meters of these locations, except for vehicles using these facilities.
### Original Function Call:
```python
Function(
  arguments='{"trigger":{"in":"highway"},"condition":{"find_signal":{"signal_type":"stop_signal","CompOp":"<","distance_num":200}},"action":{"Whether_declearation":true}}',
  name='UDrive'
)
```

### Analysis
1. **Domain‐Mismatch**  
   - The natural language description is about **parking prohibitions** (no-parking zones, buffer distances around intersections, bus stops, etc.).  
   - The given function call is about **approaching a highway toll station** (detecting a stop signal 200 m ahead and decelerating).  
   ⇒ It does not address any parking restriction.

2. **Missing “Parking” Semantics in UDrive**  
   - UDrive’s existing actions (`Mano_action`, `Whether_allow_reverse`, etc.) do not include an explicit “park” or “disallow parking” command.  
   ⇒ Even if we pointed at no-parking zones, UDrive cannot express “do not park here” with its current action vocabulary.

3. **Incorrect Trigger/Condition for Parking Rules**  
   - To encode “no parking within 50 m of an intersection,” you would need:  
     • trigger: the ego vehicle is on/approaching an intersection  
     • condition: distance_to the intersection ≤ 50 m  
   - The sample uses trigger: in `"highway"` and `find_signal: stop_signal`, which is unrelated.

### Revised Function Call

```json
[
  {
    "trigger": { "in": "no_parking_zone" },
    "action": { "Whether_allow_parking": false }
  },
  {
    "trigger": { "in": "intersection" },
    "condition": {
      "distance_to": {
        "road_type": "intersection",
        "CompOp": "<=",
        "distance_num": 50
      }
    },
    "action": { "Whether_allow_parking": false }
  },
  {
    "trigger": { "in": "railway_crossing" },
    "condition": {
      "distance_to": {
        "road_type": "railway_crossing",
        "CompOp": "<=",
        "distance_num": 50
      }
    },
    "action": { "Whether_allow_parking": false }
  },
  {
    "trigger": { "in": "bus_stop" },
    "condition": {
      "distance_to": {
        "road_type": "bus_stop",
        "CompOp": "<=",
        "distance_num": 30
      }
    },
    "action": { "Whether_allow_parking": false }
  }
  /* …and so on for emergency stations, hydrants, etc.… */
]
```

### Modifications and Reasons
- Introduced a new action property **`Whether_allow_parking`** (boolean) to explicitly permit or forbid parking.  
- For each prohibited area/type, used:
  • **trigger** “in” the relevant road segment (e.g., `no_parking_zone`, `intersection`, `bus_stop`)  
  • **condition** `distance_to` that segment ≤ the required buffer (50 m or 30 m)  
- Removed the unrelated toll-station trigger/condition since it does not address parking.  
- Noted that, with the DSL as originally defined, you cannot express “parking” at all—an extension was required.
10: Entering the Highway: Passing Through a Highway Toll Station: The toll plaza on a highway is marked with several deceleration lines, so vehicles should smoothly reduce speed when approaching. Before entering the toll station, drivers should carefully observe the traffic signals and information boards above the lanes to avoid inadvertently running a red light or violating temporary highway regulations. This awareness helps prevent traffic violations and ensures safe passage through the toll station.
### Original Function Call:
Function(
  arguments='{"trigger":{"in":"highway"},"condition":{"find_signal":{"signal_type":"stop_signal","CompOp":"<","distance_num":200}},"action":{"Whether_declearation":true}}',
  name='UDrive'
)

### Revised Function Call:
Function(
  arguments='{
    "trigger": {
      "in": "highway_exit_ramp"
    },
    "condition": {
      "find_signal": {
        "signal_type": "speed_limit_signal",
        "CompOp": "<",
        "distance_num": 200
      }
    },
    "action": {
      "Whether_declearation": true,
      "Expected_speed": {
        "speed_number": 30
      }
    }
  }',
  name='UDrive'
)

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Changed trigger from `"in": "highway"` to `"in": "highway_exit_ramp"` to target the approach to the toll station specifically (toll plazas are typically on exit ramps of highways).
- Replaced `signal_type: "stop_signal"` with `"speed_limit_signal"` to reflect the posted deceleration/speed‐limit signs and deceleration lines described in the natural language (drivers are slowing down, not stopping for a barrier yet).
- Added an `"Expected_speed"` action to prescribe a reduced target speed (e.g. 30 km/h) when within 200 m of the toll station, thereby enforcing “smoothly reduce speed” in line with the description.
- Kept `"Whether_declearation": true` to ensure the vehicle performs a controlled deceleration phase.
11: Merging onto the Highway Lane: After passing through the toll station, vehicles enter the acceleration lane. Once in the acceleration lane, drivers should activate the left turn signal and quickly increase their speed to at least 60 km/h. It's important to check for oncoming traffic in the lane to the left. Only when it is safe and does not interfere with vehicles already on the highway should you smoothly merge into the traffic lane. It is not allowed to enter the traffic lane without first accelerating, nor is it permitted to cross the solid line between the acceleration lane and the traffic lane to merge directly.
### Original Function Call 1:
Function(
  arguments = '{"trigger": {"in": "highway"},  
                 "condition": {
                   "find_signal": {
                     "signal_type": "speed_limit_signal",
                     "CompOp": "<=",
                     "distance_num": 15
                   },
                   "vehicle_state": {
                     "driving_state": "go_straight",
                     "speed": {"CompOp": "<", "speed_num": 60},
                     "state": "left_turn_light"
                   }
                 },
                 "action": {
                   "Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 60},
                   "State_action": {"target": "left_turn_light", "whether_turn_on": true}
                 }}',
  name = 'UDrive'
)

### Revised Function Call 1:
{'trigger': {'in': 'highway'},
 'condition': {
   'vehicle_state': {
     'driving_state': 'go_straight',
     'speed': {'CompOp': '<', 'speed_num': 60}
   }
 },
 'action': {
   'State_action': {'target': 'left_turn_light', 'whether_turn_on': true},
   'Expected_speed': {'speed_number': 60}
 }
}

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Removed **find_signal**: merging behavior does not depend on encountering a speed-limit sign.
- Simplified **vehicle_state** condition to only check that speed < 60 km/h while going straight.
- Combined the turn-signal action and desired speed in **action**.

### Original Function Call 2:
Function(
  arguments = '{"trigger": {"in": "highway"},
                 "condition": {
                   "vehicle_state": {
                     "driving_state": "go_straight",
                     "speed": {"CompOp": "<", "speed_num": 60}

                 }}',
  name = 'UDrive'
)

### Revised Function Call 2:
(This rule is redundant given Revised Call 1. Vehicles already set turn-signal and accelerate when speed < 60.)

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Merged with Rule 1.  There is no need for a second, identical “speed<60 → accelerate” rule without the turn-signal.

### Original Function Call 3:
Function(
  arguments = '{"trigger": {"in": "motorway"},
                 "condition": {
                   "vehicle_state": {"state": "left_turn_light"},
                   "find_obstacle": {
                     "obstacle_type": "vehicle",
                     "position": "left",
                     "direction": "same",
                     "distance": {"CompOp": ">=", "distance_num": 5}
                   }
                 },
                 "action": {
                   "Whether_allow_left_lane_change": true,
                   "Min_speed_for_keep_clear": 60
                 }}',
  name = 'UDrive'
)

### Revised Function Call 3:
{'trigger': {'in': 'highway'},
 'condition': {
   'vehicle_state': {
     'speed': {'CompOp': '>=', 'speed_num': 60}
   },
   'find_obstacle': {
     'obstacle_type': 'vehicle',
     'position': 'left',
     'direction': 'same',
     'distance': {'CompOp': '>=', 'distance_num': 20}
   }
 },
 'action': {
   'Change_lane_action': {'direction': 'left', 'times': 1}
 }
}

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Switched **trigger** back to “highway” so that merge executes as soon as the acceleration-lane joins the highway.
- Enforced **speed ≥ 60 km/h** before any merge.
- Increased safety gap to **20 m** on the left before merging.
- Replaced the permissive flag (**Whether_allow_left_lane_change**) with an explicit **Change_lane_action** to carry out the merge.
- Removed **Min_speed_for_keep_clear**, which is meant for “keep-clear” zones and not relevant here.
12: Following Distance on the Highway: When driving on the highway, if your speed exceeds 100 km/h, you should maintain a following distance of at least 100 meters from the vehicle in front. If your speed is below 100 km/h, the following distance can be slightly reduced, but it should never be less than 50 meters.
### Original Function Call:
Function(  
  arguments='{"trigger": {"in": "highway"},  
               "condition": {"vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": "<", "speed_num": 100}}},  
               "action": {"Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance": 50}}',  
  name='UDrive'  
)

### Revised Function Call:
Function(  
  arguments='[  
    {  
      "trigger":   {"in": "highway"},  
      "condition": {"vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": ">", "speed_num": 100}}},  
      "action":    {"Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance": 100}  
    },  
    {  
      "trigger":   {"in": "highway"},  
      "condition": {"vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": "<", "speed_num": 100}}},  
      "action":    {"Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance": 50}  
    }  
  ]',  
  name='UDrive'  
)

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Split into two rules in a JSON array so both speed regimes are covered.  
- Rule 1: uses CompOp “>” and speed_num 100 to capture “speed exceeds 100 km/h” and sets follow distance to 100 m.  
- Rule 2: uses CompOp “<” and speed_num 100 to capture “speed below 100 km/h” and sets follow distance to the minimum 50 m.  
- Kept the trigger “in”: “highway” for both rules to ensure they only apply on highways.
13: Lane Selection and Speed: Speed limits for different vehicles on the highway: Under normal conditions, vehicles should not exceed a maximum speed of 120 km/h or go below a minimum speed of 60 km/h.
### Original Function Call:
Function(
  arguments='{"trigger":{"in":"highway"},"condition":{"vehicle_state":{"speed":{"CompOp":"<","speed_num":60}}},"action":{"Expected_speed":{"speed_number":60}}}',
  name='UDrive'
)

### Revised Function Call:
[
  {
    "trigger": { "in": "highway" },
    "condition": {
      "vehicle_state": {
        "speed": { "CompOp": "<", "speed_num": 60 }
      }
    },
    "action": {
      "Expected_speed": { "speed_number": 60 }
    }
  },
  {
    "trigger": { "in": "highway" },
    "condition": {

      }
    },
    "action": {
      "Expected_speed": { "speed_number": 120 }
    }
  }
]

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Split into two rules to cover both the minimum‐speed and maximum‐speed requirements (speed < 60 and speed > 120).  
- Wrapped the rules in a list so both are submitted in one UDrive call.  
- Kept the trigger as `"in": "highway"` to restrict both rules to highway driving.  
- Used `"Expected_speed":{"speed_number":...}` in each action to enforce the lower/upper bound.
14: Safe Speed on the Highway: When driving on regular roads, there's a common belief that 'speed causes most accidents', especially in busy urban areas where the speeds of vehicles, non-motorized traffic, and pedestrians vary significantly, and the traffic conditions are complex. To avoid accidents, drivers must strictly control their speed. On highways, the minimum speed limit is set at 60 km/h, which would be considered high speed on urban roads. This highlights the stark contrast in speed expectations between highways and regular roads. The average speed on highways is roughly 100 km/h. Driving below this average speed means you will frequently be overtaken, which is unsafe, especially if you suddenly reduce speed, as this increases the risk of being rear-ended. Conversely, driving above the average speed involves constant overtaking, which is also risky. Defensive driving suggests that 'going with the flow' is a safer approach on highways. However, this isn't absolute. For instance, it's unwise to follow large vehicles closely, as they create significant blind spots, and in the event of a rear-end collision, the damage can be severe. Under normal conditions, the minimum speed limit on highways is 60 km/h. However, in adverse weather conditions such as fog, rain, snow, dust storms, or hail, when visibility is less than 200 meters, the maximum speed should not exceed 60 km/h. When visibility is less than 100 meters, the maximum speed should not exceed 40 km/h. If visibility drops below 50 meters, the maximum speed should not exceed 20 km/h, and vehicles should exit the highway at the nearest exit.
### Original Function Calls:
1. Function(name='UDrive',
   arguments='{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "foggy", "vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": ">", "speed_num": 60}}}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 60}}}')
2. Function(name='UDrive',
   arguments='{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining", "vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": ">", "speed_num": 60}}}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 60}}}')

4. Function(name='UDrive',
   arguments='{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "sandstorm", "vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": ">", "speed_num": 60}}}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 60}}}')
5. Function(name='UDrive',

### Issues Identified
- The spec does not define any “visibility” condition; using `distance_to` without a `road_type` is invalid.
- The highway‐exit requirement (when visibility < 50 m) isn’t represented by any existing action.
- The first five rules cap speed at 60 km/h in adverse weather but don’t check actual visibility.
- Rules 6–8 misuse `distance_to` for visibility thresholds; `distance_to` must reference a `road_type`.

### Revised Function Calls
(We introduce a new optional condition `visibility_less_than` and extend the `Mano_action` enum with `"exit_highway"`.)

1. Function(name='UDrive',

(Notice we have merged rules 6–8 into two: one for < 100 m → 40 km/h, one for < 50 m → 20 km/h + exit. The “< 200 m” cap at 60 km/h is already covered by the weather‐based rules above.)

### Modifications and Reasons
- Added a new condition **visibility_less_than** (number) to model visibility thresholds directly.  
- Removed invalid use of `distance_to` without `road_type`.  
- Ensured each adverse‐weather rule also checks that visibility < 200 m before capping speed at 60 km/h.  
- Merged the “visibility < 100 m” and “< 50 m” cases into explicit rules with appropriate speed caps.  
- Introduced a new `Mano_action` enum value **"exit_highway"** to satisfy the requirement that vehicles must exit when visibility falls below 50 m.  
- Cleaned up redundant or overlapping rules and aligned them precisely with the natural‐language spec.
15: Do Not Enter the Emergency Lane at Will: The far-right lane on the highway is designated as the emergency lane. This lane is specifically reserved for vehicles that need to make a temporary stop due to a breakdown or for emergency vehicles performing urgent tasks during traffic congestion. Vehicles not involved in these situations are not permitted to enter the emergency lane. Highways and urban expressways have high speeds and heavy traffic flow, and in the event of a chain-reaction collision or a serious accident, there is a high risk of traffic jams. In such emergencies, the accident scene needs to be cleared quickly, and injured individuals need immediate assistance. In these critical moments, police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, and tow trucks must reach the accident site as quickly as possible to rescue the injured and clear the scene, making the emergency lane a vital lifeline.
16: Exiting the Highway: To help drivers anticipate highway exits and prepare to leave the highway, exit warning signs are placed starting 2 kilometers before the exit. If you plan to exit at the upcoming exit, upon seeing this sign, you should move to the right lane. During this time, overtaking should be avoided to prevent missing the exit. At 500 meters from the exit, turn on your right turn signal and smoothly reduce your speed to below 60 km/h after entering the deceleration lane. Before entering the highway, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the route. Once on the highway, pay attention to directional signs. If you take the wrong route at a fork or miss the highway exit, do not reverse, drive against traffic, make a U-turn, or stop to ask for directions; continue driving forward and exit at the next available exit. At the highway exit, there is usually a designated U-turn spot near the toll station, which can be used to return to the highway and then exit at your intended exit. If you miss your planned exit and the next exit is far away, you can continue driving to the next service area. Use the underpass in the service area to reach the other side of the highway and look for your intended exit from that side.

### Revised Function Calls:
We split the logic into two UDrive rules to match the natural‐language requirements:

1) At 2 km before the exit sign, move to the right lane and forbid overtaking (by forbidding left‐lane changes).  
2) At 500 m before the exit ramp, turn on the right turn signal and reduce speed to ≤ 60 km/h.

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Removed the unsupported `"Whether_allow_overtaking"` flag.  In this DSL overtaking is controlled by lane‐change permissions.
- Dropped the irrelevant `find_obstacle` condition—exit preparation is triggered by distance to the exit, not by obstacles on the right.
- Split into two rules to reflect (a) right‐lane positioning at 2000 m and (b) turn signal + speed reduction at 500 m.
- For the 500 m rule, added a `State_action` to turn on the right‐turn signal and `Expected_speed` to cap speed at 60 km/h, satisfying the “smoothly reduce your speed” requirement.
17: Driving in Rainy Weather: 1. Stay Calm During Sudden Heavy Rain: When a sudden rainstorm or heavy rain hits, the wind howls, dust swirls, and the sky darkens. Non-motorized vehicle drivers and pedestrians may panic, running in all directions to avoid the rain, creating a chaotic mix of people and vehicles. In such a confusing traffic environment, drivers should remain calm and composed, operating their vehicles methodically and demonstrating their ability to manage attention. Before the rain, the road surface may be covered with dust. When it starts raining, this dust absorbs water, creating a slippery 'lubricant' on the road. At this time, it's crucial to reduce speed and drive cautiously to avoid wheel slippage or veering off course when reacting to sudden dangers by braking or steering sharply. 2. Lightning Safety During Thunderstorms: If the rain becomes too heavy to drive safely, do not hastily get out of the car to seek shelter; staying inside the vehicle is safer. If lightning strikes the car, the electrical current will travel through the car's exterior to the ground, generally keeping the occupants safe from harm. When sheltering from the rain in your car, be mindful of where you park. Avoid parking on isolated high ground, under trees, beneath power lines, near transformers, or in areas with standing water. During thunderstorms, do not use your phone to make calls; it's best to turn it off to avoid attracting lightning. 3. Using Car Lights in Rainy Weather: On rainy days, high humidity and temperature differences between the inside and outside of the vehicle can cause fog to form on the inside of the windshield, obstructing visibility. Rainwater on the windshield can also impair the driver's view. To improve visibility, you can turn on the air conditioner or heater blower to clear the fog from the inside of the windshield. Use the windshield wipers to remove rainwater from the outside. In the dim light of rainy weather, it's advisable to turn on the front and rear position lights to alert other vehicles and pedestrians. If necessary, you can also turn on the hazard warning lights to enhance visibility. When driving in low visibility conditions on a dark, rainy day, using the low beam headlights can help you see the road more clearly. Braking and Steering in Rainy Weather: In rainy conditions, visibility is poor, the road surface is slippery, and some sections may have standing water, reducing the car's braking performance. Therefore, you should reduce speed and select an appropriate gear when driving in the rain, avoiding the use of emergency braking whenever possible. On slippery roads, especially on muddy surfaces, steering should be gentle. Turn the steering wheel early, slowly, and smoothly, avoiding sudden or sharp turns to prevent the vehicle from skidding.

### Revised Function Call #1:
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"always": true},  
"condition": {"weather_is": "raining",  
              "vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": ">", "speed_num": 0}}

### Modifications and Reasons for Call #1:
- Added an **Expected_speed** of 60 km/h to explicitly enforce “reduce speed” in rainy/slippery conditions, as urged by the natural-language guidance.
- Kept **Whether_declearation** and deceleration ratios to ensure the vehicle automatically slows when encountering obstacles.
- Retained turning on **position_light**, matching “turn on the front and rear position lights” in low-visibility rain.

### Original Function Call #2:
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"always": true},  
"condition": {"weather_is": "raining",  
              "vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": "<", "speed_num": 1}}  
             },  
"action":    {"State_action": {"target": "position_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}  
}', name='UDrive')

### Revised Function Call #2:
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"always": true},  
"condition": {"weather_is": "raining",  
              "vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": "<=", "speed_num": 1}}  
             },  
"action":    {"State_action": {"target": "hazard_warning_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}  
}', name='UDrive')

### Modifications and Reasons for Call #2:
- Changed the **speed** comparison to “<= 1 km/h” so the rule fires when the vehicle is effectively stopped or crawling.
- Swapped **position_light** for **hazard_warning_light**, since the description says “if necessary, you can also turn on the hazard warning lights to enhance visibility” when stationary in heavy rain.
- This makes the second rule semantically meaningful rather than redundantly turning on lights that are already illuminated.
18: Defensive Driving in Waterlogged Conditions: When driving through water, the buoyancy and lubricating effect of water reduce the tires' traction with the ground, decreasing the vehicle's stability and increasing the likelihood of wheel spin and skidding. The water also increases the vehicle's rolling resistance. Additionally, the water waves generated by the moving vehicle can cause electrical equipment to short-circuit or fail, and they can distort the driver's perception of the road. It's also difficult to assess the condition of the road surface beneath the water. 1. Pay Attention to the Depth of Water: During the rainy season, especially in heavy rain, low-lying areas, underpasses, and tunnels often accumulate water. When encountering large, deep areas of water, do not attempt to cross hastily. First, observe if other vehicles can pass through safely, and second, consider taking an alternate route. 2. Prevent Engine Stalling: When driving through water, it is essential to keep the engine speed slightly higher to avoid stalling while maintaining a low vehicle speed to minimize water disturbance. If the engine stalls in deep water, it can be a serious issue. In such cases, attempting to restart the engine is unlikely to succeed and could cause further damage; the best course of action is to seek assistance. 3. Do Not Follow Too Closely: When driving through water, avoid following the vehicle in front too closely. Also, increase the lateral distance from oncoming vehicles to prevent water waves from causing issues like high-voltage line leakage, which could lead to engine stalling.

### Revised Function Call:
Function(
  arguments='{
    "trigger": { "in": "flooded_road" },
    "action": {
      "Expected_speed":           { "speed_number": 20 },
      "Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance": 50,
      "Lateral_buffer_distance":  30
    }
  }',
  name='UDrive'
)

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Removed the **condition** on finding a vehicle within 30 m.  
  Rationale: In waterlogged conditions the rule should continuously apply whenever the vehicle is on a flooded road (not only when another vehicle is detected within a specific range).
- Added **Expected_speed** = 20 km/h.  
  Rationale: Reducing the vehicle’s forward speed helps limit water spray and rolling resistance, matching the advice to “maintain a low vehicle speed.”
- Increased **Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance** to 50 m.  
  Rationale: A larger following gap than 30 m provides extra safety margin in reduced-traction, water-spray conditions.
- Added **Lateral_buffer_distance** = 30 m.  
  Rationale: Maintaining a wider lateral separation from oncoming traffic mitigates the risk of wave-induced electrical failures or engine stalls.
19: Defensive Driving in Snowy Conditions: In foggy conditions, outdoor visibility is low, and condensation on the windows further reduces visibility from inside the vehicle. During winter fog, the ground may be wet or icy, affecting the vehicle's braking performance. Fog often covers large areas and can persist for extended periods. 1. Keep the Windshield Clean: When driving in foggy conditions, ensure that the windshield and windows are clean. Dust on the glass can easily attract condensation, making visibility even worse. In dense fog, you can use the wipers intermittently to remove small water droplets that accumulate on the windshield. 2. Adjust Speed: When driving in fog, adjust your speed according to visibility. If visibility is within 30 meters, your speed should not exceed 20 km/h. If visibility drops to 5 meters or less, it's best to find a safe place to stop and wait until the fog clears or lightens before continuing your journey. 3. Stay on Course: In foggy weather, poor visibility can cause many drivers to deviate from their intended route. Some drivers may veer to the right side of the road to avoid collisions with oncoming vehicles, while others may drift to the left to avoid hitting bicycles traveling in the same direction. These practices increase the risk of accidents in foggy conditions and should be avoided. It's important to maintain a steady course and stay centered in your lane. 4. Use Lights Correctly: In foggy weather, you can turn on your hazard warning lights to alert other vehicles and pedestrians, applying the defensive driving principle of making yourself noticeable. It’s not advisable to use high-beam headlights in fog because their upward-angled beams will scatter off the fog, creating a white glare that makes it harder to see the road. Instead, use fog lights, which emit yellow light that penetrates fog more effectively, providing better visibility. Once the fog clears, be sure to turn off the fog lights. When driving at night in normal weather conditions, avoid using fog lights to prevent dazzling oncoming drivers. 5. Adjust Speed in Patchy Fog: Sometimes fog is unevenly distributed, appearing like floating clouds on the ground, known as patchy fog. In such conditions, vehicles may travel at higher speeds in clear areas, but as they enter foggy patches, visibility can suddenly drop. Some drivers might react by braking abruptly, which can lead to rear-end collisions. When driving in patchy fog, be alert to changes in visibility on the road ahead and adjust your speed accordingly. If visibility decreases or the fog thickens ahead, reduce your speed in advance. When following another vehicle in foggy conditions, keep an eye on the brake lights of the car in front. If the brake lights illuminate, be ready to respond quickly and prepare to brake as needed.
Below is a rule‐by‐rule semantic check and, where needed, a corrected version of each UDrive call.  For each “Original” call we point out the structural or logical issues, then offer a “Revised” call and list the concrete modifications.

### Original Function Call 1  
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "foggy"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "hazard_warning_light", "whether_turn_on": true}, "Whether_declearation": true, "Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio": 0.5}}', name='UDrive')

### Issues  
- The SDD never mentions “static obstacles” in pure fog; you should simply slow down to a safe speed rather than apply a static‐obstacle deceleration ratio.  
- There is no target “fog_light” or “high_beam” change, even though the text explicitly recommends using fog lights and avoiding high beams once fog clears.  
- Missing an explicit speed limit based on visibility (≤ 20 km/h when visibility ≤ 30 m).

### Revised Function Call 1  
Function(arguments='{"trigger":{"always":true},"condition":{"weather_is":"foggy"},"action":{"State_action":[{"target":"hazard_warning_light","whether_turn_on":true},{"target":"high_beam","whether_turn_on":false}],"Expected_speed":{"speed_number":20}}}', name='UDrive')

### Modifications and Reasons  
- Removed `Whether_declearation` + `Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio` (no static‐obstacle scenario in pure fog).  
- Added `Expected_speed:20 km/h` to enforce the ≤ 20 km/h rule when foggy.  
- Kept hazard lights on and explicitly turned off high beams (to avoid glare in fog).  
- (Sequenced the two State_action entries as a small array so both light changes happen in one rule.)

### Original Function Call 2  
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "foggy", "vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": "<=", "speed_num": 5}}}, "action": {"check_distance": 30, "Mano_action": "wait"}}', name='UDrive')

### Issues  
- The action field is named lowercase `"check_distance"` instead of the capitalized `Check_distance`.  
- Natural language calls for stopping (or pulling over) when visibility ≤ 5 m, not merely “waiting.”  
- “wait” in Mano_action means “delay start,” not “stop/pull over.”

### Revised Function Call 2  
Function(arguments='{"trigger":{"always":true},"condition":{"weather_is":"foggy","vehicle_state":{"speed":{"CompOp":"<=","speed_num":5}}},"action":{"Check_distance":30,"Mano_action":"pull_over"}}', name='UDrive')

### Modifications and Reasons  
- Renamed `check_distance` → `Check_distance` (matches spec).  
- Replaced `Mano_action":"wait"` with `"pull_over"` (find a safe place to stop).  

---

### Original Function Call 3  
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"condition": {"weather_is": "foggy", "vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": "<=", "speed_num": 30}}}}, "action": {"expected_speed": {"speed_number": 20}}}', name='UDrive')

### Issues  
- There is an extra nested `"condition": { "condition": { … }}`—only one level is allowed.  
- Action key is `"expected_speed"` instead of `Expected_speed`.

### Revised Function Call 3  
Function(arguments='{"trigger":{"always":true},"condition":{"weather_is":"foggy","vehicle_state":{"speed":{"CompOp":"<=","speed_num":30}}},"action":{"Expected_speed":{"speed_number":20}}}', name='UDrive')

### Modifications and Reasons  
- Removed one layer of nesting so `"condition"` is directly the object of constraints.  
- Renamed `"expected_speed"` → `"Expected_speed"` (capitalized to match spec).

---

### Original Function Call 4  
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"condition": {"weather_is": "foggy"}}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "fog_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}', name='UDrive')

### Issues  
- Again the extra nested `"condition"` wrapper must be removed.  
- Otherwise the fog‐light command is correct.

### Revised Function Call 4  
Function(arguments='{"trigger":{"always":true},"condition":{"weather_is":"foggy"},"action":{"State_action":{"target":"fog_light","whether_turn_on":true}}}', name='UDrive')

### Modifications and Reasons  
- Flattened out the nested `"condition"` (only one level allowed).  
- Kept `"State_action":{"target":"fog_light","whether_turn_on":true}` exactly as required to turn on fog lights.

---

With these adjustments each rule now correctly reflects the fog‐driving advice: turning on the right lights, capping speed, and safely stopping when visibility is too poor.
