1: Tailgating Prevention to Avoid Rear-End Collisions: In congested urban traffic, where vehicles move slowly with frequent stops, maintaining a 2-second following distance can create opportunities for other vehicles to cut in. Sometimes, it's impossible to maintain even a 1-second gap. In such cases, the method of counting seconds is impractical. Instead, we can set a reference point at the lower edge of the windshield to accurately control the following distance.
### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"is_jam": true, "find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "front", "distance": {"CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 5}}}, "action": {"Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance": 5}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "urban_lane"}, "condition": {"is_jam": true, "find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "front", "distance": {"CompOp": ">=", "distance_num": 2}}}, "action": {"Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance": 10, "Whether_declearation": true, "Dynamic_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio": 0.3}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Changed trigger from `"always": true` to `"in": "urban_lane"`:**  
  The natural language explicitly specifies "congested **urban** traffic," so the trigger should be road-type-specific rather than universally applicable.

- **Adjusted `distance_num` from 5 to 2 meters and reversed `CompOp` to `">="`:**  
  The description states that "maintaining a 2-second following distance" is impractical, but the proposed solution uses a **windshield reference point** (typically corresponding to a shorter physical distance like 2-3 meters in slow traffic). The inequality should ensure the rule triggers when the distance **drops below** this threshold (`<` operator is correct in the original, but the value needed adjustment). However, the revised `">="` with 2 meters ensures proactive enforcement of the minimum distance.

- **Added `Whether_declearation` and `Dynamic_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio`:**  
  Simply setting a follow distance without deceleration logic is insufficient to prevent tailgating. The action should include a deceleration mechanism to actively maintain the distance when the threshold is breached.

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "front", "distance": {"CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 5}}}, "action": {"Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance": 5}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "urban_lane"}, "condition": {"is_jam": true, "find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "front", "distance": {"CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 2}}}, "action": {"Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance": 10, "Whether_declearation": true, "Dynamic_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio": 0.3}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Added `"is_jam": true` to conditions:**  
  The rule should only apply in congested scenarios (explicitly mentioned in the natural language). Without this, the rule would activate in non-congested urban traffic, leading to overly conservative behavior.

- **Reduced `distance_num` from 5 to 2 meters:**  
  Aligns with the practical "windshield reference point" method described, which implies a shorter physical distance than time-based calculations.

- **Added deceleration parameters:**  
  Proactive speed reduction (`Whether_declearation` and `Dynamic_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio`) ensures the vehicle actively maintains the safe follow distance instead of passively relying on distance monitoring.
2: U-turn Restrictions for Vehicles: If a U-turn location is improperly chosen, it can lead to traffic congestion, result in traffic violations and fines, or even cause accidents. Therefore, defensive drivers must be aware of the locations where U-turns are prohibited. Motor vehicles are not allowed to make U-turns at places where there are signs or markings prohibiting U-turns or left turns, as well as at railroad crossings, pedestrian crosswalks, bridges, sharp curves, steep slopes, tunnels, or other dangerous sections of the road.
### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"find_signal": {"signal_type": "no_u-turn_signal", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 20}}, "action": {"Whether_allow_u_turn": false}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"find_signal": {"signal_type": "no_u-turn_signal", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 20}}, "action": {"Whether_allow_u_turn": false}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **No modifications required**: This rule correctly uses `find_signal` to detect a "no U-turn" sign within 20 meters and disables U-turns. The structure aligns with the domain knowledge about signage-based restrictions.

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **No modifications required**: Directly prohibits U-turns on railway crossings via the `in` trigger. Matches the explicit prohibition in the natural language description.

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "crosswalk"}, "action": {"Whether_allow_u_turn": false}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **No modifications required**: Correctly disallows U-turns on crosswalks, as stated in the natural language description.

---

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **No modifications required**: Matches the prohibition of U-turns on bridges as specified in the description.

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "sharp_curve"}, "action": {"Whether_allow_u_turn": false}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "sharp_curve"}, "action": {"Whether_allow_u_turn": false}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **No modifications required**: Properly enforces the U-turn ban on sharp curves, consistent with road safety guidelines.

{"trigger": {"in": "steep_slope"}, "action": {"Whether_allow_u_turn": false}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "steep_slope"}, "action": {"Whether_allow_u_turn": false}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **No modifications required**: Correctly prohibits U-turns on steep slopes, as described in the natural language.

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "tunnel"}, "action": {"Whether_allow_u_turn": false}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "tunnel"}, "action": {"Whether_allow_u_turn": false}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **No modifications required**: Aligns with the restriction on U-turns in tunnels, as specified.

---

### Summary:
All function calls are **semantically and practically valid**. They correctly map the natural language restrictions to UDrive parameters by:
1. Using `find_signal` for signage-based prohibitions.
2. Using `in` triggers for location-based prohibitions (railway crossings, crosswalks, etc.).
3. Explicitly setting `Whether_allow_u_turn` to `false` in the action.  
No structural or logical inconsistencies were found.
3: Entering and Exiting Underground Parking Lots at Low Speed: For various reasons, when driving in and out of underground parking lots or navigating within them, it's essential to maintain a defensive mindset. The entrance passage of an underground parking lot typically has a steep ramp. When descending this steep slope to enter the parking area, if the vehicle's speed has not been reduced in advance, gravity can cause the vehicle to accelerate, creating a potential hazard due to excessive speed. The road network in underground parking lots is often intricate and crisscrossed. Once a vehicle enters the parking area, the driver must pay attention to the directional arrows on the ground and the signs overhead, look for a suitable parking spot, yield to vehicles entering or exiting parking spaces, and watch out for pedestrians heading towards elevators. In such a complex environment, the driver must maintain focused attention and manage it wisely. To achieve this, it is crucial to reduce speed, allowing ample time to make decisions and react accordingly. When exiting an underground parking lot, there are often numerous curves, creating frequent blind spots. Before reaching the parking lot exit, the vehicle typically ascends a steep slope, making it difficult to observe the road conditions and increasing the challenge of vehicle control. At the parking lot exit, the vehicle may need to stop for license plate recognition or to pay parking fees, so the driver must be prepared to reduce speed and come to a complete stop if necessary.
### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "steep_slope"}, "condition": {"vehicle_state": {"driving_state": "go_straight"}}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 20}}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "steep_slope"}, "condition": {"vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": ">", "speed_num": 20}}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 10}, "Whether_declearation": true}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Added speed condition**: The original rule lacked a speed constraint, making the action to reduce speed to 20 km/h redundant if the vehicle is already below that speed. Added `vehicle_state.speed > 20 km/h` ensures deceleration is triggered only when necessary.
- **Lowered target speed**: Reduced `speed_number` from 20 to 10 km/h to better align with the description of "low speed" required in steep underground parking ramps.
- **Explicit deceleration flag**: Added `Whether_declearation: true` to enforce active speed reduction as described in the scenario.

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "tunnel"}, "condition": {}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 30}}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "steep_slope"}, "condition": {"find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "pedestrian", "position": "front", "distance": {"CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 15}}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 10}, "Min_stop_distance": 3}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Changed trigger from `tunnel` to `steep_slope`**: Underground parking lots are not semantically equivalent to tunnels. The steep ramp (already defined as `steep_slope` in the schema) is the critical road type here.
- **Added obstacle condition**: The description emphasizes watching for pedestrians near elevators and parking spots. Added a `find_obstacle` condition for pedestrians within 15 meters.
- **Added `Min_stop_distance`**: To ensure safe stopping distance when pedestrians are detected.

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "intersection"}, "condition": {"find_traffic_light": {"color": "red", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 20}}, "action": {"Mano_action": "stop"}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "steep_slope"}, "condition": {"find_signal": {"signal_type": "stop_signal", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 5}}, "action": {"Mano_action": "stop", "Creep_time": {"reason": "stop_signal", "time": 3}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Removed unrelated `intersection` trigger**: The scenario focuses on parking lots, not general intersections.
- **Added `stop_signal` detection**: Parking lot exits often require stops for license plate recognition/payment. Used `find_signal` with `stop_signal` type.
- **Added `Creep_time`**: Slow crawling after stopping aligns with the need to cautiously navigate exit ramps with blind spots.

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "crosswalk"}, "condition": {"find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "pedestrian", "position": "front", "distance": {"CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 10}}}, "action": {"Mano_action": "stop"}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "steep_slope"}, "condition": {"find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "front", "distance": {"CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 8}}}, "action": {"Mano_action": "yield", "Lateral_buffer_distance": 1.5}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Removed `crosswalk` trigger**: Parking lot internal roads lack formal crosswalks. Used `steep_slope` to cover general parking lot navigation.
- **Added vehicle-yielding logic**: The description explicitly mentions yielding to vehicles entering/exiting parking spaces. Added a `vehicle` obstacle condition with a short detection distance (8m).
- **Added `Lateral_buffer_distance`**: Ensures safe side clearance when yielding in narrow parking areas.

---

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Contextual Alignment**: All rules now target `steep_slope` (for ramps) or use `always` with parking-specific conditions instead of unrelated road types like `tunnel`/`intersection`/`crosswalk`.
2. **Safety Refinements**: Added obstacle detection, buffer distances, and creep/wait times to address blind spots, pedestrian interactions, and complex navigation.
3. **Parameter Validation**: Fixed invalid parameter structures (e.g., nested `Expected_speed` and `Whether_declearation` usage).
4: Overtaking Restrictions: Defensive driving emphasizes the importance of proper overtaking rules. The basic rule for overtaking is to pass the vehicle in front from the left side, not from the right side. Many traffic accidents are caused by improper overtaking. So, in which situations is overtaking not advisable? 1. Do Not Overtake a Vehicle with the Left Turn Signal On: When the vehicle in front has its left turn signal on, the following vehicle should not attempt to overtake. Doing so could lead to a collision as the front vehicle might turn left at any moment. 2. Avoid Overtaking in Complex Situations: Do not overtake in areas where traffic conditions are complex, such as intersections, curves, tunnels, pedestrian crossings, railroad crossings, narrow bridges, and busy urban streets. Overtaking in such places increases the risk of accidents. When driving on steep roads, pay close attention to the traffic markings. Visibility is often limited on uphill sections, making it difficult to see oncoming traffic. Always stay to the right side of the road and do not cross the centerline to overtake, as this could result in a head-on collision. 3. Do Not Overtake Vehicles on Emergency Duty: It is important not to overtake vehicles on emergency duty, such as police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, and emergency repair vehicles. These vehicles need to reach their destinations as quickly as possible, and they are often already traveling at high speeds. Attempting to overtake them could lead to speeding violations and increased risk of accidents.
### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "front", "state": "left_turn_light"}}, "action": {"Whether_allow_left_lane_change": false}}

{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "emergency", "position": "front"}}, "action": {"Whether_allow_left_lane_change": false, "Whether_allow_right_lane_change": false}}
```

5: Application of Defensive Strategies in Yielding and Overtaking: In the context of overtaking, the vehicle being overtaken is in a 'strategic defensive' position. To prevent any contact with the overtaking vehicle, the driver of the vehicle being overtaken should, upon noticing the overtaking signal from the vehicle behind, assess the situation. If there are no dynamic or static obstacles on the road ahead and no oncoming traffic, the driver should facilitate the overtaking process by reducing speed and moving to the right. If necessary, the driver can also activate the right turn signal to indicate to the vehicle behind that it is safe to pass. From a defensive driving perspective, the driver of the vehicle being overtaken should make a judgment based on the current road conditions to determine whether it is safe to allow the overtaking vehicle to pass. Improperly yielding can lead to traffic accidents, so it is crucial to make this decision carefully. Overtaking when it is unsafe can lead to traffic accidents, and yielding when it is not appropriate can also result in accidents. When the vehicle in front allows another vehicle to overtake, it should not only demonstrate courteous behavior but also adhere to principles and strategies. Allowing an overtaking maneuver when the conditions are not suitable is actually detrimental to traffic safety. In such cases, it's better to prioritize safety over courtesy and avoid creating dangerous situations.
### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "back", "direction": "same", "distance": {"CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 20}}}, "action": {"Whether_allow_right_lane_change": true, "Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 30}}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Added front obstacle checks**: Added `find_obstacle` conditions to ensure no obstacles within 50m ahead (`position: front`, `distance: >50`) and no oncoming vehicles (`direction: opposite`, `distance: >100`). This aligns with the requirement to check for "no dynamic/static obstacles ahead and no oncoming traffic."
- **Replaced `Whether_allow_right_lane_change` with `Change_lane_action`**: The original parameter only allows lane changes but does not execute them. `Change_lane_action` explicitly triggers a right lane change.
- **Replaced `Expected_speed` with `Dynamic_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio`**: The scenario requires proactive speed reduction for safety, which is better captured by a deceleration ratio (20% speed reduction) rather than a fixed speed target.
- **Added `State_action` for right turn signal**: This explicitly signals intent to yield, as described in the scenario.

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Added front obstacle checks**: Same as above.
- **Added `Change_lane_action`**: The original action only signaled but did not execute the lane change.
- **Added `Dynamic_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio`**: Speed reduction is critical for safe yielding, which was missing in the original call.

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Added front obstacle checks**: Same as above.
- **Replaced `Expected_speed` with `Dynamic_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio`**: Fixed-speed targets are less flexible than proportional deceleration for dynamic scenarios.
- **Added `Change_lane_action`**: Ensures the vehicle actively moves right instead of passively allowing it.

---

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Conditions**:
   - Added checks for no obstacles ahead (`front` with `distance > 50m`).
   - Added checks for no oncoming traffic (`direction: opposite`, `distance > 100m`).
2. **Actions**:
   - Replaced permissions (`Whether_allow_right_lane_change`) with explicit lane changes (`Change_lane_action`).
   - Used `Dynamic_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio` instead of `Expected_speed` for safer speed adaptation.
   - Unified signaling (`right_turn_light`) across all calls for consistency.
6: Respecting Public Buses and School Buses: 1.Do Not Follow Too Closely Behind Buses: When approaching intersections with traffic signals, following a large bus too closely can lead to accidentally running a red light or ignoring a no-entry sign due to obscured visibility. 2.Be Cautious Near Bus Stops: In areas with bus stops, non-motorized vehicles may enter the motor vehicle lane to bypass the bus, and passengers getting on or off the bus might cross the road. Motor vehicles passing through these areas should proceed with caution, slow down, and yield to non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians. If the bus is blocking the lane and prevents you from passing, you should stop and wait until it is safe to proceed. 3.Yield to School Buses: When a school bus is picking up or dropping off students, it will activate its hazard lights and extend the stop sign, stopping on the right side of the road. If the school bus is stopped on a road with only one lane in each direction, vehicles behind it must stop and wait, and are not allowed to overtake. If the bus is stopped on a road with two or more lanes in each direction, vehicles in the same lane as the bus, as well as those in the adjacent lane, must stop and wait. Vehicles in other lanes should slow down and pass with caution.

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Removed `"is_special_lane": "bus_lane"`**: The rule applies to general urban lanes, not dedicated bus lanes.
- **Added `"vehicle_state": {"driving_state": "go_straight"}`**: Ensures the rule applies only when the ego vehicle is moving straight, aligning with the scenario's focus on lane-blocking buses.
- **Changed `Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio` to `Dynamic_...`**: The obstacle (bus) is dynamic.

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Added `"find_signal": {"signal_type": "school_signal", ...}`**: School buses activate hazard lights and stop signs, which map to `school_signal` in the schema.
- **Changed `Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio` to `Dynamic_...`**: School buses are dynamic obstacles.
- **Removed `"is_special_lane": "bus_lane"`**: School buses stop on regular roads, not necessarily bus lanes.

---

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Removed Incorrect Lane Constraints**: The `"is_special_lane": "bus_lane"` was overused and irrelevant to scenarios about general bus interactions.
2. **Added Signal/Obstacle Conditions**: Used `find_signal` for traffic/school signals and additional `find_obstacle` checks for buses.
3. **Dynamic vs. Static Obstacle Fixes**: Replaced `Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio` with `Dynamic_...` where obstacles are moving.
4. **Context-Specific Triggers**: Narrowed `"always": true` to `"in": "urban_lane"` for relevance.
5. **Action Refinements**: Changed `"stop"` to `"yield"` where appropriate and added `school_signal` conditions for school bus rules.

: 7: Navigating Signal-Controlled Intersections: 1.Slow Down and Choose the Correct Lane: Before approaching a signalized intersection, you should start easing off the accelerator pedal 30 to 100 meters before the intersection, allowing the vehicle to decelerate smoothly. If driving on a road with two or more lanes in the same direction, pay attention to the directional arrows marked on the pavement and the lane direction signs suspended above the road to ensure you are in the correct lane for your intended route. Entering the Intersection: First-Come, First-Served: The first cycle of the green light at an intersection is referred to as the 'first green', while the second cycle is called the 'second green'. The principle of allowing vehicles from the first green light to proceed before those from the second green light is essential for maintaining order at the intersection and is also a key factor in determining liability in traffic accidents. Extending this principle, if vehicles that entered the intersection during the previous green light have not yet cleared the intersection, vehicles from the subsequent green light cycle should not enter the intersection until it is clear.

### Key Systemic Improvements:
1. **Spatial Context:** Replaced ambiguous `"in": "intersection"` triggers with precise distance-based approaches
2. **Safety Protocols:** Added complementary parameters (buffer distances, creep times) to prevent standalone action use
3. **Behavior Validation:** Enforced speed/state checks for critical maneuvers (e.g., full stop before right-on-red)
4. **Conflict Prevention:** Removed contradictory condition groupings that could cause undefined behavior
5. **Domain Compliance:** Aligned all stopping/yielding logic with actual traffic engineering standards
8: Navigating Unsignalized Intersections: 1. Right Turn Path at Intersections: When making a right turn at an intersection, the driver should be vigilant for oncoming traffic from the left. Only when it is safe to do so should the vehicle make the turn, staying close to the right side of the road. This approach minimizes the risk of interference with vehicles approaching from the side. 2. Left Turn Path at Intersections: At intersections marked with a center circle, vehicles making a left turn should keep close to the left side of the center circle while turning. At intersections without a marked center circle, vehicles should take a wide left turn, following a path that stays slightly to the right within the intersection. This approach helps ensure a safe and smooth turn. 3. Right of Way for Straight-Through Vehicles: At intersections without traffic signals, signs, or markings, when vehicles from different directions meet, the vehicle on the left must yield to the vehicle approaching from the right. This rule ensures safe passage through the intersection. 4. Right of Way Between Turning and Straight-Through Vehicles: At intersections without traffic signals, signs, or markings, when vehicles from different directions meet, vehicles making a right or left turn must yield to vehicles going straight through the intersection. This ensures that straight-through vehicles have the right of way, reducing the risk of accidents. 5. Right of Way Between Left-Turning and Right-Turning Vehicles: At intersections without traffic signals, vehicles turning right must yield to vehicles turning left from the opposite direction, including motor vehicles and non-motorized vehicles. This rule also applies to intersections controlled by red, yellow, and green traffic lights. This ensures that left-turning vehicles have the priority to pass through the intersection safely. 6. Right-of-Way Between Vehicles on the Right and the Main Road: According to Article 52, Item 2 of the `Regulations for the Implementation of the Road Traffic Safety Law', when a motor vehicle approaches an intersection without traffic signals, police direction, or control signs/markings, the driver must stop and yield to vehicles coming from the right before entering the intersection. The principle of 'yielding to vehicles from the right' can be broken down into three scenarios: 1) Right Lane Vehicle Going Straight, Main Road Vehicle Going Straight or Turning: The vehicle on the main road must yield to the vehicle on the right lane. 2) Both Vehicles Turning: If both the vehicle on the right lane and the vehicle on the main road are turning, the vehicle on the main road must yield to the vehicle on the right lane. 3) Right Lane Vehicle Turning, Main Road Vehicle Going Straight: In this case, the right lane vehicle must yield to the vehicle on the main road going straight. 7. Roundabout Traffic Rules: Vehicles preparing to enter a roundabout must yield to those already circulating within the roundabout. When entering the roundabout, drivers should not use their turn signals. However, when exiting the roundabout, drivers must activate their right turn signal. Vehicles inside the roundabout must travel in a counterclockwise direction around the central island; driving clockwise to take a shortcut is prohibited.

```
### Modifications and Reasons:
- Added `distance_to` condition to activate the signal only when approaching an exit.
- Set `distance_num: 15` meters as a reasonable preparation distance for signaling.

```
### Modifications and Reasons:
- Added `distance_to` condition with `>= 15` meters to deactivate the signal after exiting.
- Ensures the signal turns off post-exit to avoid misleading indications.

```
### Modifications and Reasons:
- Added `find_obstacle` condition to ensure no oncoming left-turning vehicles are present.
- Changed `Expected_speed` to use `limit_speed: true` instead of a fixed value for compliance.
- Added `Check_distance: 30` meters to enforce forward vigilance.
9: Avoid Parking Violations: 1. No-Parking Zones: Parking is prohibited in areas with no-parking signs or markings, on roads where there are barriers between the motor vehicle lane and the non-motorized vehicle lane or sidewalk, and at pedestrian crossings or construction sites. 2. No Parking Within 50 Meters: Parking is prohibited within 50 meters of intersections, railroad crossings, sharp curves, roads narrower than 4 meters, bridges, steep slopes, tunnels, and the road sections within 50 meters of these locations. 3. No Parking Within 30 Meters: Parking is prohibited within 30 meters of bus stops, emergency stations, gas stations, fire hydrants, or fire station entrances, and on the road sections within 30 meters of these locations, except for vehicles using these facilities.
### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "no_parking_zone"}, "action": {"Mano_action": "stop", "Whether_allow_reverse": false}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "no_parking_zone"}, "action": {"Whether_allow_reverse": false, "Stopping_distance": {"reason": "no_parking_zone", "distance": 0}, "Whether_check": {"check_type": "keep_clear", "check_sign": true}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Removed `Mano_action: "stop"`:** Parking prohibition does not mean the vehicle should stop; it means the vehicle must actively avoid stopping/parking. The original action contradicts the goal.
- **Added `Stopping_distance`:** Explicitly enforce zero tolerance for stopping in no-parking zones.
- **Added `Whether_check`:** Enable monitoring for "keep_clear" zones (implied by no-parking rules).

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"distance_to": {"road_type": "intersection", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 50}}, "action": {"Mano_action": "stop", "Whether_allow_reverse": false}}

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Removed `Mano_action: "stop"`:** Proximity to an intersection requires avoidance of parking, not an immediate stop.
- **Added `Stopping_distance`:** Enforce a 5-meter buffer to prevent parking near intersections.

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"distance_to": {"road_type": "crosswalk", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 30}}, "action": {"Mano_action": "stop", "Whether_allow_reverse": false}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "no_parking_zone"}, "condition": {"distance_to": {"road_type": "crosswalk", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 0}}, "action": {"Whether_allow_reverse": false}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Merged with `no_parking_zone` trigger:** Crosswalks are already part of no-parking zones per the natural language description.
- **Removed `Mano_action: "stop"`:** Avoid paradoxical stopping in no-parking areas.

---

### Summary of Key Issues:
1. **Contradictory `Mano_action: "stop"`:** Parking prohibition rules should **prevent** stopping, not enforce it.
2. **Misuse of `road_type`:** Facilities like bus stops and emergency lanes are not valid `road_type` values in the schema.
3. **Incomplete Coverage:** The original calls missed conditions like barriers between lanes and construction sites (schema limitations).
4. **Buffer Logic:** Used `distance_to` for proximity but failed to pair it with actions like `Stopping_distance` to enforce buffers.
10: Entering the Highway: Passing Through a Highway Toll Station: The toll plaza on a highway is marked with several deceleration lines, so vehicles should smoothly reduce speed when approaching. Before entering the toll station, drivers should carefully observe the traffic signals and information boards above the lanes to avoid inadvertently running a red light or violating temporary highway regulations. This awareness helps prevent traffic violations and ensures safe passage through the toll station.
### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"find_signal": {"signal_type": "speed_limit_signal", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 100}}, "action": {"Whether_declearation": true, "Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio": 0.5}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "motorway"}, "condition": {"find_signal": {"signal_type": "speed_limit_signal", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 200}, "distance_to": {"road_type": "motorway", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 200}}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 40}, "Preparation_distance": {"reason": "speed_limit_signal", "distance": 200}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Trigger correction**: Changed `"highway"` to `"motorway"` since `"highway"` is not a valid road type in the UDrive enum.
- **Added `distance_to` condition**: Added `distance_to` to specify proximity to the toll station (implicitly represented as part of the motorway) to align with the requirement to prepare for deceleration.
- **Replaced obstacle deceleration with expected speed**: Removed `Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio` (irrelevant for speed limit signals) and used `Expected_speed` to enforce a reduced speed of 40 km/h.
- **Added `Preparation_distance`**: Introduced a 200-meter preparation distance for speed adjustment, matching the description of "smoothly reduce speed when approaching."
- **Fixed parameter spelling**: Corrected `"Whether_declearation"` to `"Whether_deceleration"` (though removed in this revision due to better alignment with `Expected_speed`).

### Original Function Call:
```json

```

### Revised Function Call:

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Trigger correction**: Changed `"highway"` to `"motorway"`.
- **Increased detection distance**: Extended `distance_num` from 50 to 100 meters to ensure safe stopping time.
- **Added `vehicle_state` constraint**: Restricted the rule to apply only when the vehicle is going straight, as toll stations typically require straight-line stops.
- **Added `Stopping_distance`**: Specified a 10-meter buffer from the stop line to align with real-world toll booth safety practices.

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"find_traffic_light": {"color": "green", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 50}}, "action": {"Mano_action": "launch"}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "motorway"}, "condition": {"find_traffic_light": {"color": "green", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 50}, "vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": "<=", "speed_num": 5}}}, "action": {"Mano_action": "launch", "Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 30}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Trigger correction**: Changed `"highway"` to `"motorway"`.
- **Added low-speed precondition**: Added `vehicle_state.speed <= 5 km/h` to ensure the vehicle is already moving slowly (as required after stopping at a toll booth).
- **Added `Expected_speed`**: Set a post-launch speed of 30 km/h to enforce smooth acceleration after passing the toll station.
11: Merging onto the Highway Lane: After passing through the toll station, vehicles enter the acceleration lane. Once in the acceleration lane, drivers should activate the left turn signal and quickly increase their speed to at least 60 km/h. It's important to check for oncoming traffic in the lane to the left. Only when it is safe and does not interfere with vehicles already on the highway should you smoothly merge into the traffic lane. It is not allowed to enter the traffic lane without first accelerating, nor is it permitted to cross the solid line between the acceleration lane and the traffic lane to merge directly.
### Original Function Call 1:

  }
}
```

### Revised Function Call 1:
```json
{
  "trigger": {"in": "motorway"},
  "condition": {

    "Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 60},
    "Check_distance": 100
  }
}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
1. **Trigger Correction**: Changed `"highway"` to `"motorway"` to match the schema's enum values.
2. **Removed Special Lane Condition**: Removed `"is_special_lane": "fast_lane"` since acceleration lanes are distinct from fast lanes and not listed in the schema's `is_special_lane` enum.
3. **Speed Format Fix**: Changed `"Expected_speed": 60` to `"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 60}` to match the schema's object structure.
4. **Simplified Driving State**: Removed `"change_lane_to_left"` from driving state since lane change initiation belongs in the action phase, not the precondition.

  },
  "action": {
    "Change_lane_action": {"direction": "left", "times": 1},
    "Whether_allow_left_lane_change": true
  }
}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
1. **Trigger Correction**: Changed `"highway"` to `"motorway"` for schema compliance.
2. **Added Obstacle Direction**: Added `"direction": "same"` to clarify traffic flow alignment (highway merging implies same-direction traffic).
3. **Explicit Lane Change Permission**: Added `"Whether_allow_left_lane_change": true` to explicitly enable lane changes.
4. **Removed Special Lane Condition**: Removed `"is_special_lane": "fast_lane"` as acceleration lanes are not schema-defined special lanes.

---

### Summary of Improvements:
- **Schema Compliance**: Ensured all enum values (`motorway` instead of `highway`) and parameter structures (`Expected_speed` object) match the schema.
- **Semantic Accuracy**: Removed invalid special lane references and added critical missing fields (e.g., obstacle direction).
- **Action-Condition Alignment**: Separated precondition checks (speed <60) from actions (accelerate to 60) to avoid logical conflicts.
- **Safety Enhancements**: Added directional clarity for obstacle checks to reflect real-world highway merging logic.
12: Following Distance on the Highway: When driving on the highway, if your speed exceeds 100 km/h, you should maintain a following distance of at least 100 meters from the vehicle in front. If your speed is below 100 km/h, the following distance can be slightly reduced, but it should never be less than 50 meters.

  "condition": {
    "vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": "<=", "speed_num": 100}}
  },
  "action": {"Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance": 50}
}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Fixed trigger road type**: Changed `"highway"` to `"motorway"` in both calls. The UDrive parameter schema explicitly lists `"motorway"` as a valid road type in the `enum` (not "highway").
- **Corrected structure**: Moved the `action` parameter to the root level (it was incorrectly nested under `condition`). The UDrive schema requires `trigger`, `condition`, and `action` to be sibling properties.
- **Simplified condition syntax**: Removed redundant nesting under `vehicle_state.speed` to match the schema structure (`vehicle_state.speed` directly contains `CompOp` and `speed_num`).
- **Added safety margin (optional improvement)**: While not strictly invalid, adding a `Check_distance` parameter in the action (e.g., `"Check_distance": 150` for the first rule) would better align with the "forward area requiring attention" described in autonomous driving best practices.
13: Lane Selection and Speed: Speed limits for different vehicles on the highway: Under normal conditions, vehicles should not exceed a maximum speed of 120 km/h or go below a minimum speed of 60 km/h.
### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 90, "limit_speed": true}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "motorway"}, "condition": {"vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": ">", "speed_num": 120}}}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 120}}
{"trigger": {"in": "motorway"}, "condition": {"vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": "<", "speed_num": 60}}}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 120}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
1. **Trigger Correction**  
   - Changed `"in": "highway"` → `"in": "motorway"`  
   *Reason*: The parameter schema specifies "motorway" as the valid enum value for highways, not "highway".

2. **Condition Enhancement**  
   - Added `vehicle_state.speed` constraints to check for both upper and lower bounds:  
     `{"CompOp": ">", "speed_num": 120}` (max speed violation)  
     `{"CompOp": "<", "speed_num": 60}` (min speed violation)  
   *Reason*: The natural language description requires dual constraints (60-120 km/h). The original empty `condition` failed to enforce this range.

3. **Action Correction**  
   - Removed `"limit_speed": true` and set `"speed_number": 120` explicitly  
   *Reason*:  
     - The `limit_speed` parameter is for following speed limit signs, not general rules.  
     - Setting both `speed_number` and `limit_speed` violates the schema's "either/or" requirement.  
     - 120 km/h aligns with the stated maximum speed limit.  

4. **Structural Validity**  
   - Split the speed constraints into separate comparison objects in `vehicle_state.speed` to avoid ambiguity in compound conditions.
14: Safe Speed on the Highway: When driving on regular roads, there's a common belief that 'speed causes most accidents', especially in busy urban areas where the speeds of vehicles, non-motorized traffic, and pedestrians vary significantly, and the traffic conditions are complex. To avoid accidents, drivers must strictly control their speed. On highways, the minimum speed limit is set at 60 km/h, which would be considered high speed on urban roads. This highlights the stark contrast in speed expectations between highways and regular roads. The average speed on highways is roughly 100 km/h. Driving below this average speed means you will frequently be overtaken, which is unsafe, especially if you suddenly reduce speed, as this increases the risk of being rear-ended. Conversely, driving above the average speed involves constant overtaking, which is also risky. Defensive driving suggests that 'going with the flow' is a safer approach on highways. However, this isn't absolute. For instance, it's unwise to follow large vehicles closely, as they create significant blind spots, and in the event of a rear-end collision, the damage can be severe. Under normal conditions, the minimum speed limit on highways is 60 km/h. However, in adverse weather conditions such as fog, rain, snow, dust storms, or hail, when visibility is less than 200 meters, the maximum speed should not exceed 60 km/h. When visibility is less than 100 meters, the maximum speed should not exceed 40 km/h. If visibility drops below 50 meters, the maximum speed should not exceed 20 km/h, and vehicles should exit the highway at the nearest exit.

```json
{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"time_is": "daytime", "weather_is": "foggy", "find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "front", "distance": {"CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 200}}}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 60, "limit_speed": true}}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "motorway"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "foggy"}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"limit_speed": true}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Trigger correction**: Changed `"highway"` to `"motorway"` to align with the enum values in the UDrive parameters.
- **Removed `find_obstacle` condition**: Visibility constraints in the natural language description are environmental conditions, not directly tied to obstacle proximity. UDrive lacks a direct visibility parameter, so using obstacle distance as a proxy is semantically invalid.
- **Simplified action**: Removed explicit `speed_number: 60` since `"limit_speed": true` implies adherence to weather-dependent speed limits (assumed to be enforced by external systems).

{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"time_is": "daytime", "weather_is": "foggy", "find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "vehicle", "position": "front", "distance": {"CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 100}}}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 40, "limit_speed": true}}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "motorway"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "foggy"}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"limit_speed": true}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Trigger correction**: Same as above (`"motorway"`).
- **Removed granular visibility logic**: UDrive cannot model visibility tiers (100m/50m) directly. A single rule for adverse weather with `limit_speed: true` is more consistent with the DSL's capabilities.
- **Removed redundant `time_is`**: Daytime is the default if not specified.

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Trigger correction**: Same as above.
- **Added `Preparation_distance`**: Provides a practical buffer for exiting the highway safely.
- **Removed arbitrary speed number**: Relies on `limit_speed: true` for dynamic adjustments.
- **Retained `pull_over`**: Matches the requirement to exit during extreme low visibility.

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"time_is": "daytime"}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 100, "limit_speed": false}}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "motorway"}, "condition": {"weather_is": null}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"limit_speed": true}, "Whether_priority_change_lane": true}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Trigger correction**: Same as above.
- **Added `weather_is: null`**: Explicitly excludes adverse weather conditions.
- **Removed fixed speed**: `limit_speed: true` ensures compliance with posted limits instead of a rigid 100 km/h.
- **Added lane priority**: Encourages "going with the flow" behavior as described in the natural language.
15: Do Not Enter the Emergency Lane at Will: The far-right lane on the highway is designated as the emergency lane. This lane is specifically reserved for vehicles that need to make a temporary stop due to a breakdown or for emergency vehicles performing urgent tasks during traffic congestion. Vehicles not involved in these situations are not permitted to enter the emergency lane. Highways and urban expressways have high speeds and heavy traffic flow, and in the event of a chain-reaction collision or a serious accident, there is a high risk of traffic jams. In such emergencies, the accident scene needs to be cleared quickly, and injured individuals need immediate assistance. In these critical moments, police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, and tow trucks must reach the accident site as quickly as possible to rescue the injured and clear the scene, making the emergency lane a vital lifeline.
### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"is_special_lane": "emergency_lane"}, "action": {"Mano_action": "stop", "Whether_allow_borrow_right_lane": false}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "motorway"}, "condition": {"is_special_lane": "emergency_lane"}, "action": {"Whether_allow_right_lane_change": false, "Whether_allow_borrow_right_lane": false}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
1. **Trigger correction**: Changed `"highway"` to `"motorway"` in the trigger.  
   - **Reason**: The parameter enum explicitly lists `"motorway"` as the valid road type (not `"highway"`). This aligns with the domain-specific terminology in the UDrive schema.

2. **Removed `Mano_action: "stop"`**:  
   - **Reason**: The natural language description focuses on **preventing entry** into the emergency lane, not stopping vehicles already in it. The `"stop"` action would conflict with highway driving logic and could cause unsafe behavior if applied while the vehicle is in motion.

3. **Added `Whether_allow_right_lane_change: false`**:  
   - **Reason**: The emergency lane is typically the far-right lane on highways. Explicitly disabling right lane changes ensures the vehicle cannot actively choose to enter the emergency lane. This directly enforces the rule "Do Not Enter the Emergency Lane at Will."

4. **Retained `Whether_allow_borrow_right_lane: false`**:  
   - **Reason**: This prevents temporary borrowing of the emergency lane (e.g., for overtaking), which aligns with the rule’s intent to reserve the lane strictly for emergencies.
16: Exiting the Highway: To help drivers anticipate highway exits and prepare to leave the highway, exit warning signs are placed starting 2 kilometers before the exit. If you plan to exit at the upcoming exit, upon seeing this sign, you should move to the right lane. During this time, overtaking should be avoided to prevent missing the exit. At 500 meters from the exit, turn on your right turn signal and smoothly reduce your speed to below 60 km/h after entering the deceleration lane. Before entering the highway, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the route. Once on the highway, pay attention to directional signs. If you take the wrong route at a fork or miss the highway exit, do not reverse, drive against traffic, make a U-turn, or stop to ask for directions; continue driving forward and exit at the next available exit. At the highway exit, there is usually a designated U-turn spot near the toll station, which can be used to return to the highway and then exit at your intended exit. If you miss your planned exit and the next exit is far away, you can continue driving to the next service area. Use the underpass in the service area to reach the other side of the highway and look for your intended exit from that side.

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Trigger correction**: Changed `"highway"` to `"motorway"` to match the valid enum value in the schema.
- **Condition adjustment**: Changed `"<"` to `"<="` to include the exact 2000m threshold and corrected `road_type` to `"motorway"`.
- **Added lane change action**: Added `Change_lane_action` to explicitly instruct the vehicle to move to the right lane, aligning with the natural language instruction.

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Trigger/condition correction**: Updated `"highway"` to `"motorway"` and `"<"` to `"<="` for inclusivity.
- **Speed enforcement**: Added `"limit_speed": true` to enforce speed limits and `"Whether_declearation": true` with a deceleration ratio to ensure gradual slowing.
- **Clarity**: Explicitly linked speed reduction to obstacle deceleration logic for consistency.

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Terminology fix**: Changed `"highway"` to `"motorway"` and `"<"` to `"<="`.
- **Overtaking prevention**: Added `"Whether_allow_left_lane_change": false` to explicitly block overtaking (via left lane changes).

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"distance_to": {"road_type": "highway", "CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 500}}, "action": {"Mano_action": "stop"}}
```

### **Invalid Function Call**  
**Reason**: The natural language explicitly prohibits stopping if the exit is missed. This rule contradicts the requirement to "continue driving forward" and should be **removed entirely**.

---

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Terminology**: All instances of `"highway"` replaced with `"motorway"` to match schema constraints.
2. **Distance inclusivity**: Changed comparison operators (`<` to `<=`) to ensure rules activate at exact thresholds.
3. **Action refinement**: Added explicit lane-change directives, speed-limit adherence, and deceleration logic.
4. **Removed invalid rule**: The "stop" action at 500m was removed to align with the prohibition against stopping after missing an exit.
17: Driving in Rainy Weather: 1. Stay Calm During Sudden Heavy Rain: When a sudden rainstorm or heavy rain hits, the wind howls, dust swirls, and the sky darkens. Non-motorized vehicle drivers and pedestrians may panic, running in all directions to avoid the rain, creating a chaotic mix of people and vehicles. In such a confusing traffic environment, drivers should remain calm and composed, operating their vehicles methodically and demonstrating their ability to manage attention. Before the rain, the road surface may be covered with dust. When it starts raining, this dust absorbs water, creating a slippery 'lubricant' on the road. At this time, it's crucial to reduce speed and drive cautiously to avoid wheel slippage or veering off course when reacting to sudden dangers by braking or steering sharply. 2. Lightning Safety During Thunderstorms: If the rain becomes too heavy to drive safely, do not hastily get out of the car to seek shelter; staying inside the vehicle is safer. If lightning strikes the car, the electrical current will travel through the car's exterior to the ground, generally keeping the occupants safe from harm. When sheltering from the rain in your car, be mindful of where you park. Avoid parking on isolated high ground, under trees, beneath power lines, near transformers, or in areas with standing water. During thunderstorms, do not use your phone to make calls; it's best to turn it off to avoid attracting lightning. 3. Using Car Lights in Rainy Weather: On rainy days, high humidity and temperature differences between the inside and outside of the vehicle can cause fog to form on the inside of the windshield, obstructing visibility. Rainwater on the windshield can also impair the driver's view. To improve visibility, you can turn on the air conditioner or heater blower to clear the fog from the inside of the windshield. Use the windshield wipers to remove rainwater from the outside. In the dim light of rainy weather, it's advisable to turn on the front and rear position lights to alert other vehicles and pedestrians. If necessary, you can also turn on the hazard warning lights to enhance visibility. When driving in low visibility conditions on a dark, rainy day, using the low beam headlights can help you see the road more clearly. Braking and Steering in Rainy Weather: In rainy conditions, visibility is poor, the road surface is slippery, and some sections may have standing water, reducing the car's braking performance. Therefore, you should reduce speed and select an appropriate gear when driving in the rain, avoiding the use of emergency braking whenever possible. On slippery roads, especially on muddy surfaces, steering should be gentle. Turn the steering wheel early, slowly, and smoothly, avoiding sudden or sharp turns to prevent the vehicle from skidding.
### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "low_beam", "whether_turn_on": true}}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "urban_lane"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining", "time_is": "night"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "low_beam", "whether_turn_on": true}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Changed trigger from `"always": true` to `"in": "urban_lane"`:** The original `"always"` trigger is too broad. Low beams are primarily needed in urban lanes or roads with traffic, not all road types.
- **Added `"time_is": "night"` to conditions:** Low beams are explicitly mentioned for use in "dark, rainy days," which aligns with nighttime conditions. The original condition applied to all rainy scenarios, including daytime.

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "position_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "position_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **No changes required:** The description explicitly states that position lights should be turned on in rainy weather to improve visibility. The trigger `"always"` is acceptable here since position lights are a general safety measure in rain.

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "hazard_warning_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "flooded_road"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining", "is_jam": true}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "hazard_warning_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Changed trigger to `"in": "flooded_road"`:** Hazard lights should only activate in extreme conditions like flooded roads, not all rainy scenarios.
- **Added `"is_jam": true` to conditions:** Hazard lights are contextually valid in traffic jams caused by heavy rain. The original call incorrectly enabled them unconditionally, which violates traffic norms.

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining"}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 30}}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "muddy_road"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining"}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 30}, "Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio": 0.4}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Changed trigger to `"in": "muddy_road"`:** The description emphasizes reducing speed specifically on slippery roads caused by rain mixing with dust. The original `"always"` trigger was too broad.
- **Added `"Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio": 0.4`:** Reducing speed via `Expected_speed` alone is insufficient. A deceleration ratio ensures gradual speed reduction to avoid skidding.

---

### Additional Missing Rules:
1. **Windshield Management:**  
   ```json
   {"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "fog_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}
   ```
   - **Reason:** The description mentions using fog lights to improve visibility, but this was missing in the original calls.

2. **Avoiding Emergency Braking:**  
   ```json
   {"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining"}, "action": {"Forward_buffer_distance": 15}}
   ```
   - **Reason:** Increasing the buffer distance ensures safer stopping in slippery conditions.

3. **Lightning Safety:**  
   ```json
   {"trigger": {"in": "mountain_road"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining"}, "action": {"Mano_action": "pull_over", "State_action": {"target": "hazard_warning_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}
   ```
   - **Reason:** Pulling over and activating hazard lights is critical in isolated areas (e.g., mountain roads) during thunderstorms.

---

### Summary:
- **Semantic Validity:** Original calls used overly broad triggers (`"always"`) and ignored road-specific conditions (e.g., `flooded_road`, `muddy_road`).
- **Domain Knowledge:** Hazard lights should not be enabled while driving unless in extreme scenarios. Speed reduction must account for road slipperiness, not just rain.
- **Practicality:** Added missing actions (fog lights, buffer distances) and refined triggers/conditions to align with real-world driving norms.
18: Defensive Driving in Waterlogged Conditions: When driving through water, the buoyancy and lubricating effect of water reduce the tires' traction with the ground, decreasing the vehicle's stability and increasing the likelihood of wheel spin and skidding. The water also increases the vehicle's rolling resistance. Additionally, the water waves generated by the moving vehicle can cause electrical equipment to short-circuit or fail, and they can distort the driver's perception of the road. It's also difficult to assess the condition of the road surface beneath the water. 1. Pay Attention to the Depth of Water: During the rainy season, especially in heavy rain, low-lying areas, underpasses, and tunnels often accumulate water. When encountering large, deep areas of water, do not attempt to cross hastily. First, observe if other vehicles can pass through safely, and second, consider taking an alternate route. 2. Prevent Engine Stalling: When driving through water, it is essential to keep the engine speed slightly higher to avoid stalling while maintaining a low vehicle speed to minimize water disturbance. If the engine stalls in deep water, it can be a serious issue. In such cases, attempting to restart the engine is unlikely to succeed and could cause further damage; the best course of action is to seek assistance. 3. Do Not Follow Too Closely: When driving through water, avoid following the vehicle in front too closely. Also, increase the lateral distance from oncoming vehicles to prevent water waves from causing issues like high-voltage line leakage, which could lead to engine stalling.

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Reduced `speed_number` from 20 to 15 km/h to align with "low vehicle speed to minimize water disturbance"
- Increased `Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance` from 10m to 20m to account for reduced traction
- Added `Whether_declearation: true` and `Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio: 30` to enforce proactive speed reduction
- Removed redundant `limit_speed: false` since no speed limit signal is mentioned

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Changed `distance_num` from 15m to 20m for earlier reaction
- Replaced `Mano_action: "stop"` with deceleration parameters to prevent dangerous sudden stops in water
- Added 40% deceleration ratio for gradual speed reduction
- Removed direct stopping to avoid engine stalling risk

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "flooded_road"}, "condition": {}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "position_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Changed trigger from general rain to flooded_road context
- Replaced hazard lights with position lights (hazard lights should only be used when stationary)
- Removed redundant weather condition since flooded_road implies heavy rain
- Matched with proper lighting requirements for water navigation

---

### Original Function Call:

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- Added `not_in: "flooded_road"` to avoid rule conflict
- Reduced speed from 30 to 25 km/h for general rain safety
- Added `Preparation_distance` to anticipate flooded areas
- Maintained separation between general rain and flood-specific rules

---

### Additional Missing Rule:
**Engine Stall Prevention:**
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "flooded_road"}, "condition": {"vehicle_state": {"speed": {"CompOp": "<=", "speed_num": 0}}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "hazard_warning_light", "whether_turn_on": true}, "Mano_action": "pull_over"}}
```
**Reason:** Implements "do not restart engine" guidance by activating hazard lights and pulling over when stationary in flooded conditions.
19: Defensive Driving in Snowy Conditions: In foggy conditions, outdoor visibility is low, and condensation on the windows further reduces visibility from inside the vehicle. During winter fog, the ground may be wet or icy, affecting the vehicle's braking performance. Fog often covers large areas and can persist for extended periods. 1. Keep the Windshield Clean: When driving in foggy conditions, ensure that the windshield and windows are clean. Dust on the glass can easily attract condensation, making visibility even worse. In dense fog, you can use the wipers intermittently to remove small water droplets that accumulate on the windshield. 2. Adjust Speed: When driving in fog, adjust your speed according to visibility. If visibility is within 30 meters, your speed should not exceed 20 km/h. If visibility drops to 5 meters or less, it's best to find a safe place to stop and wait until the fog clears or lightens before continuing your journey. 3. Stay on Course: In foggy weather, poor visibility can cause many drivers to deviate from their intended route. Some drivers may veer to the right side of the road to avoid collisions with oncoming vehicles, while others may drift to the left to avoid hitting bicycles traveling in the same direction. These practices increase the risk of accidents in foggy conditions and should be avoided. It's important to maintain a steady course and stay centered in your lane. 4. Use Lights Correctly: In foggy weather, you can turn on your hazard warning lights to alert other vehicles and pedestrians, applying the defensive driving principle of making yourself noticeable. It’s not advisable to use high-beam headlights in fog because their upward-angled beams will scatter off the fog, creating a white glare that makes it harder to see the road. Instead, use fog lights, which emit yellow light that penetrates fog more effectively, providing better visibility. Once the fog clears, be sure to turn off the fog lights. When driving at night in normal weather conditions, avoid using fog lights to prevent dazzling oncoming drivers. 5. Adjust Speed in Patchy Fog: Sometimes fog is unevenly distributed, appearing like floating clouds on the ground, known as patchy fog. In such conditions, vehicles may travel at higher speeds in clear areas, but as they enter foggy patches, visibility can suddenly drop. Some drivers might react by braking abruptly, which can lead to rear-end collisions. When driving in patchy fog, be alert to changes in visibility on the road ahead and adjust your speed accordingly. If visibility decreases or the fog thickens ahead, reduce your speed in advance. When following another vehicle in foggy conditions, keep an eye on the brake lights of the car in front. If the brake lights illuminate, be ready to respond quickly and prepare to brake as needed.
### Original Function Call:

```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Changed `trigger` from `{"in": "icy_road"}` to `{"always": true}`:** The natural language focuses on foggy conditions, not specifically icy roads. Using `"always": true` ensures the rule applies universally when fog is present.
- **Replaced `"weather_is": "snowing"` with `"weather_is": "foggy"`:** The description explicitly addresses foggy conditions, not snowy weather.
- **Added `find_obstacle` condition:** The speed limit of 20 km/h is contextually tied to visibility (≤30 meters). Using `find_obstacle` with `distance_num: 30` and `CompOp: "<"` approximates visibility constraints by checking for obstacles within 30 meters ahead.

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "foggy"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "hazard_warning_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **No changes required:** This rule correctly activates hazard warning lights in foggy conditions, aligning with the description’s instruction to "make yourself noticeable."

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "foggy"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "high_beam", "whether_turn_on": false}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **No changes required:** This rule correctly disables high beams in foggy conditions to avoid glare, as specified in the natural language description.

---

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Semantic Alignment:** Fixed mismatches between triggers/conditions (e.g., `snowing` → `foggy`, `icy_road` → `always`).
2. **Visibility Constraints:** Added `find_obstacle` conditions to approximate visibility checks where speed adjustments are required.
3. **Action Consistency:** Ensured actions (e.g., fog lights, hazard lights) matched the described defensive driving strategies.
20: Defensive Driving in Strong Winds and Dusty Conditions: 1. Dust Prevention in Dust Storms: When driving in dusty conditions, keep the cabin sealed by tightly closing the car windows and setting the air circulation system to the recirculation mode. This prevents dust from entering the cabin, as shown in Figure 4-16. Simply closing the windows is not enough; if the air circulation is set to the external mode, dust from outside can enter the cabin through the air conditioning system. Additionally, do not use the windshield wipers to remove dust from the windshield while driving. Doing so not only fails to clear the dust effectively but also causes scratches on the glass due to friction, increasing wear on the wiper blades. The dry friction caused by this can also damage the wiper motor. 2. Impact of Strong Winds on Driving Safety: Wind direction and strength can significantly affect a vehicle's stability, especially when driving on highways, ring roads, or elevated roads where there is little to no wind protection from buildings. In strong winds, if the wind is blowing in the same direction as the vehicle, the braking distance will be longer, so it's important to start braking earlier. If the wind is blowing against the direction of travel, it can reduce the vehicle's acceleration, making overtaking more difficult and prolonged. When overtaking or passing obstacles, these factors should be considered to allow for a safety margin. Lateral wind can cause the vehicle to drift off course, and when taking sharp turns at high speeds in strong winds, if the wind direction aligns with the centrifugal force generated by the turn, the vehicle is more prone to skidding or even overturning. The faster the speed, the greater the centrifugal force, and the smaller the turning radius, the greater the risk. Therefore, in strong wind conditions, it's crucial to drive at a moderate speed and avoid sharp steering. 3. Parking Techniques to Avoid Strong Winds: If you encounter a violent storm while driving and continuing is difficult, for safety, you should find a sheltered spot to park your vehicle. When choosing a location to park, avoid areas near tall billboards, power transformers, or other potentially dangerous structures. In mountainous or hilly areas, you can use the natural terrain as a windbreak. If it is difficult to find a sheltered spot, park the car with the rear facing the wind and the front sheltered. This position reduces the impact of sand and stones on the vehicle and helps prevent the car from being overturned by the storm. Parking with the sides of the vehicle facing the wind is less stable and increases the risk of the vehicle being blown over.
### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "sandstorm"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "position_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "sandstorm"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "hazard_warning_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Changed `position_light` to `hazard_warning_light`:** The natural language emphasizes hazard mitigation in sandstorms. Hazard lights are standard for low-visibility scenarios, while position lights are primarily for stationary visibility. This aligns better with domain knowledge for dusty/sandstorm conditions.

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "sandstorm"}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 60}}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "sandstorm"}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 40}}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Reduced `speed_number` from 60 to 40 km/h:** The description stresses driving at a "moderate speed" to counteract wind instability and longer braking distances. A fixed 60 km/h is too high for safe sandstorm driving on highways, where reduced speeds are critical for maintaining control.

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "sandstorm"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "hazard_warning_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}
```

### Analysis:
- **Valid.** This correctly activates hazard lights on highways during sandstorms, which is consistent with standard safety protocols for low-visibility conditions.

---

### Original Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "sandstorm"}, "action": {"Whether_declearation": true, "Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio": 20}}
```

### Revised Function Call:
```json
{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "sandstorm", "find_obstacle": {"obstacle_type": "all", "position": "front", "distance": {"CompOp": "<", "distance_num": 100}}}, "action": {"Dynamic_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio": 30}}
```

### Modifications and Reasons:
- **Removed `Whether_declearation` and `Static_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio`:** These parameters require a static obstacle condition, which is not explicitly mentioned in the natural language description. 
- **Added `find_obstacle` condition:** The description implicitly references dynamic hazards (e.g., reduced visibility, wind effects). Using `Dynamic_Obstacle_Deceleration_ratio` with a front obstacle detection condition ensures proactive speed reduction for moving hazards.
- **Increased deceleration ratio to 30%:** Strong winds and dust reduce reaction time, requiring more aggressive speed adjustments.

---

### Summary of Improvements:
1. **Action Alignment:** Adjusted light and speed actions to better reflect real-world sandstorm protocols (e.g., hazard lights instead of position lights).
2. **Parameter Validity:** Removed misuse of static obstacle parameters in dynamic environments and added relevant obstacle detection logic.
3. **Safety Margins:** Reduced speed thresholds and increased deceleration ratios to prioritize safety in unstable conditions.
4. **Condition Specificity:** Added `find_obstacle` to ensure actions are contextually triggered by actual hazards.
