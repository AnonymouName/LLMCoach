1: Tailgating Prevention to Avoid Rear-End Collisions: In congested urban traffic, where vehicles move slowly with frequent stops, maintaining a 2-second following distance can create opportunities for other vehicles to cut in. Sometimes, it's impossible to maintain even a 1-second gap. In such cases, the method of counting seconds is impractical. Instead, we can set a reference point at the lower edge of the windshield to accurately control the following distance.

2: U-turn Restrictions for Vehicles: If a U-turn location is improperly chosen, it can lead to traffic congestion, result in traffic violations and fines, or even cause accidents. Therefore, defensive drivers must be aware of the locations where U-turns are prohibited. Motor vehicles are not allowed to make U-turns at places where there are signs or markings prohibiting U-turns or left turns, as well as at railroad crossings, pedestrian crosswalks, bridges, sharp curves, steep slopes, tunnels, or other dangerous sections of the road.

3: Entering and Exiting Underground Parking Lots at Low Speed: For various reasons, when driving in and out of underground parking lots or navigating within them, it's essential to maintain a defensive mindset. The entrance passage of an underground parking lot typically has a steep ramp. When descending this steep slope to enter the parking area, if the vehicle's speed has not been reduced in advance, gravity can cause the vehicle to accelerate, creating a potential hazard due to excessive speed. The road network in underground parking lots is often intricate and crisscrossed. Once a vehicle enters the parking area, the driver must pay attention to the directional arrows on the ground and the signs overhead, look for a suitable parking spot, yield to vehicles entering or exiting parking spaces, and watch out for pedestrians heading towards elevators. In such a complex environment, the driver must maintain focused attention and manage it wisely. To achieve this, it is crucial to reduce speed, allowing ample time to make decisions and react accordingly. When exiting an underground parking lot, there are often numerous curves, creating frequent blind spots. Before reaching the parking lot exit, the vehicle typically ascends a steep slope, making it difficult to observe the road conditions and increasing the challenge of vehicle control. At the parking lot exit, the vehicle may need to stop for license plate recognition or to pay parking fees, so the driver must be prepared to reduce speed and come to a complete stop if necessary.

4: Overtaking Restrictions: Defensive driving emphasizes the importance of proper overtaking rules. The basic rule for overtaking is to pass the vehicle in front from the left side, not from the right side. Many traffic accidents are caused by improper overtaking. So, in which situations is overtaking not advisable? 1. Do Not Overtake a Vehicle with the Left Turn Signal On: When the vehicle in front has its left turn signal on, the following vehicle should not attempt to overtake. Doing so could lead to a collision as the front vehicle might turn left at any moment. 2. Avoid Overtaking in Complex Situations: Do not overtake in areas where traffic conditions are complex, such as intersections, curves, tunnels, pedestrian crossings, railroad crossings, narrow bridges, and busy urban streets. Overtaking in such places increases the risk of accidents. When driving on steep roads, pay close attention to the traffic markings. Visibility is often limited on uphill sections, making it difficult to see oncoming traffic. Always stay to the right side of the road and do not cross the centerline to overtake, as this could result in a head-on collision. 3. Do Not Overtake Vehicles on Emergency Duty: It is important not to overtake vehicles on emergency duty, such as police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, and emergency repair vehicles. These vehicles need to reach their destinations as quickly as possible, and they are often already traveling at high speeds. Attempting to overtake them could lead to speeding violations and increased risk of accidents.

5: Application of Defensive Strategies in Yielding and Overtaking: In the context of overtaking, the vehicle being overtaken is in a 'strategic defensive' position. To prevent any contact with the overtaking vehicle, the driver of the vehicle being overtaken should, upon noticing the overtaking signal from the vehicle behind, assess the situation. If there are no dynamic or static obstacles on the road ahead and no oncoming traffic, the driver should facilitate the overtaking process by reducing speed and moving to the right. If necessary, the driver can also activate the right turn signal to indicate to the vehicle behind that it is safe to pass. From a defensive driving perspective, the driver of the vehicle being overtaken should make a judgment based on the current road conditions to determine whether it is safe to allow the overtaking vehicle to pass. Improperly yielding can lead to traffic accidents, so it is crucial to make this decision carefully. Overtaking when it is unsafe can lead to traffic accidents, and yielding when it is not appropriate can also result in accidents. When the vehicle in front allows another vehicle to overtake, it should not only demonstrate courteous behavior but also adhere to principles and strategies. Allowing an overtaking maneuver when the conditions are not suitable is actually detrimental to traffic safety. In such cases, it's better to prioritize safety over courtesy and avoid creating dangerous situations.

6: Respecting Public Buses and School Buses: 1.Do Not Follow Too Closely Behind Buses: When approaching intersections with traffic signals, following a large bus too closely can lead to accidentally running a red light or ignoring a no-entry sign due to obscured visibility. 2.Be Cautious Near Bus Stops: In areas with bus stops, non-motorized vehicles may enter the motor vehicle lane to bypass the bus, and passengers getting on or off the bus might cross the road. Motor vehicles passing through these areas should proceed with caution, slow down, and yield to non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians. If the bus is blocking the lane and prevents you from passing, you should stop and wait until it is safe to proceed. 3.Yield to School Buses: When a school bus is picking up or dropping off students, it will activate its hazard lights and extend the stop sign, stopping on the right side of the road. If the school bus is stopped on a road with only one lane in each direction, vehicles behind it must stop and wait, and are not allowed to overtake. If the bus is stopped on a road with two or more lanes in each direction, vehicles in the same lane as the bus, as well as those in the adjacent lane, must stop and wait. Vehicles in other lanes should slow down and pass with caution.

7: Navigating Signal-Controlled Intersections: 1.Slow Down and Choose the Correct Lane: Before approaching a signalized intersection, you should start easing off the accelerator pedal 30 to 100 meters before the intersection, allowing the vehicle to decelerate smoothly. If driving on a road with two or more lanes in the same direction, pay attention to the directional arrows marked on the pavement and the lane direction signs suspended above the road to ensure you are in the correct lane for your intended route. Entering the Intersection: First-Come, First-Served: The first cycle of the green light at an intersection is referred to as the 'first green', while the second cycle is called the 'second green'. The principle of allowing vehicles from the first green light to proceed before those from the second green light is essential for maintaining order at the intersection and is also a key factor in determining liability in traffic accidents. Extending this principle, if vehicles that entered the intersection during the previous green light have not yet cleared the intersection, vehicles from the subsequent green light cycle should not enter the intersection until it is clear.

8: Navigating Unsignalized Intersections: 1. Right Turn Path at Intersections: When making a right turn at an intersection, the driver should be vigilant for oncoming traffic from the left. Only when it is safe to do so should the vehicle make the turn, staying close to the right side of the road. This approach minimizes the risk of interference with vehicles approaching from the side. 2. Left Turn Path at Intersections: At intersections marked with a center circle, vehicles making a left turn should keep close to the left side of the center circle while turning. At intersections without a marked center circle, vehicles should take a wide left turn, following a path that stays slightly to the right within the intersection. This approach helps ensure a safe and smooth turn. 3. Right of Way for Straight-Through Vehicles: At intersections without traffic signals, signs, or markings, when vehicles from different directions meet, the vehicle on the left must yield to the vehicle approaching from the right. This rule ensures safe passage through the intersection. 4. Right of Way Between Turning and Straight-Through Vehicles: At intersections without traffic signals, signs, or markings, when vehicles from different directions meet, vehicles making a right or left turn must yield to vehicles going straight through the intersection. This ensures that straight-through vehicles have the right of way, reducing the risk of accidents. 5. Right of Way Between Left-Turning and Right-Turning Vehicles: At intersections without traffic signals, vehicles turning right must yield to vehicles turning left from the opposite direction, including motor vehicles and non-motorized vehicles. This rule also applies to intersections controlled by red, yellow, and green traffic lights. This ensures that left-turning vehicles have the priority to pass through the intersection safely. 6. Right-of-Way Between Vehicles on the Right and the Main Road: According to Article 52, Item 2 of the `Regulations for the Implementation of the Road Traffic Safety Law', when a motor vehicle approaches an intersection without traffic signals, police direction, or control signs/markings, the driver must stop and yield to vehicles coming from the right before entering the intersection. The principle of 'yielding to vehicles from the right' can be broken down into three scenarios: 1) Right Lane Vehicle Going Straight, Main Road Vehicle Going Straight or Turning: The vehicle on the main road must yield to the vehicle on the right lane. 2) Both Vehicles Turning: If both the vehicle on the right lane and the vehicle on the main road are turning, the vehicle on the main road must yield to the vehicle on the right lane. 3) Right Lane Vehicle Turning, Main Road Vehicle Going Straight: In this case, the right lane vehicle must yield to the vehicle on the main road going straight. 7. Roundabout Traffic Rules: Vehicles preparing to enter a roundabout must yield to those already circulating within the roundabout. When entering the roundabout, drivers should not use their turn signals. However, when exiting the roundabout, drivers must activate their right turn signal. Vehicles inside the roundabout must travel in a counterclockwise direction around the central island; driving clockwise to take a shortcut is prohibited.

9: Avoid Parking Violations: 1. No-Parking Zones: Parking is prohibited in areas with no-parking signs or markings, on roads where there are barriers between the motor vehicle lane and the non-motorized vehicle lane or sidewalk, and at pedestrian crossings or construction sites. 2. No Parking Within 50 Meters: Parking is prohibited within 50 meters of intersections, railroad crossings, sharp curves, roads narrower than 4 meters, bridges, steep slopes, tunnels, and the road sections within 50 meters of these locations. 3. No Parking Within 30 Meters: Parking is prohibited within 30 meters of bus stops, emergency stations, gas stations, fire hydrants, or fire station entrances, and on the road sections within 30 meters of these locations, except for vehicles using these facilities.

10: Entering the Highway: Passing Through a Highway Toll Station: The toll plaza on a highway is marked with several deceleration lines, so vehicles should smoothly reduce speed when approaching. Before entering the toll station, drivers should carefully observe the traffic signals and information boards above the lanes to avoid inadvertently running a red light or violating temporary highway regulations. This awareness helps prevent traffic violations and ensures safe passage through the toll station.

11: Merging onto the Highway Lane: After passing through the toll station, vehicles enter the acceleration lane. Once in the acceleration lane, drivers should activate the left turn signal and quickly increase their speed to at least 60 km/h. It's important to check for oncoming traffic in the lane to the left. Only when it is safe and does not interfere with vehicles already on the highway should you smoothly merge into the traffic lane. It is not allowed to enter the traffic lane without first accelerating, nor is it permitted to cross the solid line between the acceleration lane and the traffic lane to merge directly.

12: Following Distance on the Highway: When driving on the highway, if your speed exceeds 100 km/h, you should maintain a following distance of at least 100 meters from the vehicle in front. If your speed is below 100 km/h, the following distance can be slightly reduced, but it should never be less than 50 meters.

13: Lane Selection and Speed: Speed limits for different vehicles on the highway: Under normal conditions, vehicles should not exceed a maximum speed of 120 km/h or go below a minimum speed of 60 km/h.
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"in": "highway"}, "condition": {}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 90, "limit_speed": true}}}', name='UDrive')

14: Safe Speed on the Highway: When driving on regular roads, there's a common belief that 'speed causes most accidents', especially in busy urban areas where the speeds of vehicles, non-motorized traffic, and pedestrians vary significantly, and the traffic conditions are complex. To avoid accidents, drivers must strictly control their speed. On highways, the minimum speed limit is set at 60 km/h, which would be considered high speed on urban roads. This highlights the stark contrast in speed expectations between highways and regular roads. The average speed on highways is roughly 100 km/h. Driving below this average speed means you will frequently be overtaken, which is unsafe, especially if you suddenly reduce speed, as this increases the risk of being rear-ended. Conversely, driving above the average speed involves constant overtaking, which is also risky. Defensive driving suggests that 'going with the flow' is a safer approach on highways. However, this isn't absolute. For instance, it's unwise to follow large vehicles closely, as they create significant blind spots, and in the event of a rear-end collision, the damage can be severe. Under normal conditions, the minimum speed limit on highways is 60 km/h. However, in adverse weather conditions such as fog, rain, snow, dust storms, or hail, when visibility is less than 200 meters, the maximum speed should not exceed 60 km/h. When visibility is less than 100 meters, the maximum speed should not exceed 40 km/h. If visibility drops below 50 meters, the maximum speed should not exceed 20 km/h, and vehicles should exit the highway at the nearest exit.

15: Do Not Enter the Emergency Lane at Will: The far-right lane on the highway is designated as the emergency lane. This lane is specifically reserved for vehicles that need to make a temporary stop due to a breakdown or for emergency vehicles performing urgent tasks during traffic congestion. Vehicles not involved in these situations are not permitted to enter the emergency lane. Highways and urban expressways have high speeds and heavy traffic flow, and in the event of a chain-reaction collision or a serious accident, there is a high risk of traffic jams. In such emergencies, the accident scene needs to be cleared quickly, and injured individuals need immediate assistance. In these critical moments, police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, and tow trucks must reach the accident site as quickly as possible to rescue the injured and clear the scene, making the emergency lane a vital lifeline.

16: Exiting the Highway: To help drivers anticipate highway exits and prepare to leave the highway, exit warning signs are placed starting 2 kilometers before the exit. If you plan to exit at the upcoming exit, upon seeing this sign, you should move to the right lane. During this time, overtaking should be avoided to prevent missing the exit. At 500 meters from the exit, turn on your right turn signal and smoothly reduce your speed to below 60 km/h after entering the deceleration lane. Before entering the highway, it’s important to familiarize yourself with the route. Once on the highway, pay attention to directional signs. If you take the wrong route at a fork or miss the highway exit, do not reverse, drive against traffic, make a U-turn, or stop to ask for directions; continue driving forward and exit at the next available exit. At the highway exit, there is usually a designated U-turn spot near the toll station, which can be used to return to the highway and then exit at your intended exit. If you miss your planned exit and the next exit is far away, you can continue driving to the next service area. Use the underpass in the service area to reach the other side of the highway and look for your intended exit from that side.

17: Driving in Rainy Weather: 1. Stay Calm During Sudden Heavy Rain: When a sudden rainstorm or heavy rain hits, the wind howls, dust swirls, and the sky darkens. Non-motorized vehicle drivers and pedestrians may panic, running in all directions to avoid the rain, creating a chaotic mix of people and vehicles. In such a confusing traffic environment, drivers should remain calm and composed, operating their vehicles methodically and demonstrating their ability to manage attention. Before the rain, the road surface may be covered with dust. When it starts raining, this dust absorbs water, creating a slippery 'lubricant' on the road. At this time, it's crucial to reduce speed and drive cautiously to avoid wheel slippage or veering off course when reacting to sudden dangers by braking or steering sharply. 2. Lightning Safety During Thunderstorms: If the rain becomes too heavy to drive safely, do not hastily get out of the car to seek shelter; staying inside the vehicle is safer. If lightning strikes the car, the electrical current will travel through the car's exterior to the ground, generally keeping the occupants safe from harm. When sheltering from the rain in your car, be mindful of where you park. Avoid parking on isolated high ground, under trees, beneath power lines, near transformers, or in areas with standing water. During thunderstorms, do not use your phone to make calls; it's best to turn it off to avoid attracting lightning. 3. Using Car Lights in Rainy Weather: On rainy days, high humidity and temperature differences between the inside and outside of the vehicle can cause fog to form on the inside of the windshield, obstructing visibility. Rainwater on the windshield can also impair the driver's view. To improve visibility, you can turn on the air conditioner or heater blower to clear the fog from the inside of the windshield. Use the windshield wipers to remove rainwater from the outside. In the dim light of rainy weather, it's advisable to turn on the front and rear position lights to alert other vehicles and pedestrians. If necessary, you can also turn on the hazard warning lights to enhance visibility. When driving in low visibility conditions on a dark, rainy day, using the low beam headlights can help you see the road more clearly. Braking and Steering in Rainy Weather: In rainy conditions, visibility is poor, the road surface is slippery, and some sections may have standing water, reducing the car's braking performance. Therefore, you should reduce speed and select an appropriate gear when driving in the rain, avoiding the use of emergency braking whenever possible. On slippery roads, especially on muddy surfaces, steering should be gentle. Turn the steering wheel early, slowly, and smoothly, avoiding sudden or sharp turns to prevent the vehicle from skidding.

18: Defensive Driving in Waterlogged Conditions: When driving through water, the buoyancy and lubricating effect of water reduce the tires' traction with the ground, decreasing the vehicle's stability and increasing the likelihood of wheel spin and skidding. The water also increases the vehicle's rolling resistance. Additionally, the water waves generated by the moving vehicle can cause electrical equipment to short-circuit or fail, and they can distort the driver's perception of the road. It's also difficult to assess the condition of the road surface beneath the water. 1. Pay Attention to the Depth of Water: During the rainy season, especially in heavy rain, low-lying areas, underpasses, and tunnels often accumulate water. When encountering large, deep areas of water, do not attempt to cross hastily. First, observe if other vehicles can pass through safely, and second, consider taking an alternate route. 2. Prevent Engine Stalling: When driving through water, it is essential to keep the engine speed slightly higher to avoid stalling while maintaining a low vehicle speed to minimize water disturbance. If the engine stalls in deep water, it can be a serious issue. In such cases, attempting to restart the engine is unlikely to succeed and could cause further damage; the best course of action is to seek assistance. 3. Do Not Follow Too Closely: When driving through water, avoid following the vehicle in front too closely. Also, increase the lateral distance from oncoming vehicles to prevent water waves from causing issues like high-voltage line leakage, which could lead to engine stalling.

19: Defensive Driving in Snowy Conditions: In foggy conditions, outdoor visibility is low, and condensation on the windows further reduces visibility from inside the vehicle. During winter fog, the ground may be wet or icy, affecting the vehicle's braking performance. Fog often covers large areas and can persist for extended periods. 1. Keep the Windshield Clean: When driving in foggy conditions, ensure that the windshield and windows are clean. Dust on the glass can easily attract condensation, making visibility even worse. In dense fog, you can use the wipers intermittently to remove small water droplets that accumulate on the windshield. 2. Adjust Speed: When driving in fog, adjust your speed according to visibility. If visibility is within 30 meters, your speed should not exceed 20 km/h. If visibility drops to 5 meters or less, it's best to find a safe place to stop and wait until the fog clears or lightens before continuing your journey. 3. Stay on Course: In foggy weather, poor visibility can cause many drivers to deviate from their intended route. Some drivers may veer to the right side of the road to avoid collisions with oncoming vehicles, while others may drift to the left to avoid hitting bicycles traveling in the same direction. These practices increase the risk of accidents in foggy conditions and should be avoided. It's important to maintain a steady course and stay centered in your lane. 4. Use Lights Correctly: In foggy weather, you can turn on your hazard warning lights to alert other vehicles and pedestrians, applying the defensive driving principle of making yourself noticeable. It’s not advisable to use high-beam headlights in fog because their upward-angled beams will scatter off the fog, creating a white glare that makes it harder to see the road. Instead, use fog lights, which emit yellow light that penetrates fog more effectively, providing better visibility. Once the fog clears, be sure to turn off the fog lights. When driving at night in normal weather conditions, avoid using fog lights to prevent dazzling oncoming drivers. 5. Adjust Speed in Patchy Fog: Sometimes fog is unevenly distributed, appearing like floating clouds on the ground, known as patchy fog. In such conditions, vehicles may travel at higher speeds in clear areas, but as they enter foggy patches, visibility can suddenly drop. Some drivers might react by braking abruptly, which can lead to rear-end collisions. When driving in patchy fog, be alert to changes in visibility on the road ahead and adjust your speed accordingly. If visibility decreases or the fog thickens ahead, reduce your speed in advance. When following another vehicle in foggy conditions, keep an eye on the brake lights of the car in front. If the brake lights illuminate, be ready to respond quickly and prepare to brake as needed.

20: Defensive Driving in Strong Winds and Dusty Conditions: 1. Dust Prevention in Dust Storms: When driving in dusty conditions, keep the cabin sealed by tightly closing the car windows and setting the air circulation system to the recirculation mode. This prevents dust from entering the cabin, as shown in Figure 4-16. Simply closing the windows is not enough; if the air circulation is set to the external mode, dust from outside can enter the cabin through the air conditioning system. Additionally, do not use the windshield wipers to remove dust from the windshield while driving. Doing so not only fails to clear the dust effectively but also causes scratches on the glass due to friction, increasing wear on the wiper blades. The dry friction caused by this can also damage the wiper motor. 2. Impact of Strong Winds on Driving Safety: Wind direction and strength can significantly affect a vehicle's stability, especially when driving on highways, ring roads, or elevated roads where there is little to no wind protection from buildings. In strong winds, if the wind is blowing in the same direction as the vehicle, the braking distance will be longer, so it's important to start braking earlier. If the wind is blowing against the direction of travel, it can reduce the vehicle's acceleration, making overtaking more difficult and prolonged. When overtaking or passing obstacles, these factors should be considered to allow for a safety margin. Lateral wind can cause the vehicle to drift off course, and when taking sharp turns at high speeds in strong winds, if the wind direction aligns with the centrifugal force generated by the turn, the vehicle is more prone to skidding or even overturning. The faster the speed, the greater the centrifugal force, and the smaller the turning radius, the greater the risk. Therefore, in strong wind conditions, it's crucial to drive at a moderate speed and avoid sharp steering. 3. Parking Techniques to Avoid Strong Winds: If you encounter a violent storm while driving and continuing is difficult, for safety, you should find a sheltered spot to park your vehicle. When choosing a location to park, avoid areas near tall billboards, power transformers, or other potentially dangerous structures. In mountainous or hilly areas, you can use the natural terrain as a windbreak. If it is difficult to find a sheltered spot, park the car with the rear facing the wind and the front sheltered. This position reduces the impact of sand and stones on the vehicle and helps prevent the car from being overturned by the storm. Parking with the sides of the vehicle facing the wind is less stable and increases the risk of the vehicle being blown over.
