1: General Principles of Road Traffic: Motor vehicles and non-motor vehicles must travel on the right side of the road. The principle of 'Each in its own lane' refers to vehicles and pedestrians traveling within their respective designated parts of the road according to the division of the roadway. Traffic signs carry the force of administrative orders, and all road users must strictly adhere to them to ensure the safety and smooth flow of traffic, as well as to prevent traffic accidents.
2: Motor Vehicle Speed Limits: 1.Speed Limits Under Normal Traffic Conditions: Motor vehicles must not exceed the speed indicated by speed limit signs and markings when driving on the road. In the absence of such signs or markings, motor vehicles must not exceed the following maximum speeds:1)On roads without a central dividing line: 30 km/h on urban roads, 40 km/h on roads.2)On roads with only one lane for motor vehicles in the same direction: 50 km/h on urban roads, 70 km/h on roads. 2.Speed Limits Under Adverse Traffic Conditions: When encountering any of the following situations while driving, motor vehicles must not exceed a maximum speed of 30 km/h. Tractors, electric vehicles, and specialized wheeled machinery must not exceed 15 km/h. 1)When entering or exiting a non-motorized vehicle lane, or when passing through a railway crossing, sharp curve, narrow road, or narrow bridge. 2)When making a U-turn, turning, or driving down a steep slope. 3)When visibility is within 50 meters due to fog, rain, snow, dust, or hail. 4)When driving on icy or muddy roads. 5)When towing a motor vehicle that has broken down.

3: Safe Following Distance and Overtaking: 1.Safe Following Distance for Motor Vehicles: The safe following distance refers to the minimum distance required to avoid a collision if the vehicle in front suddenly stops. While driving on the road, vehicles should maintain an appropriate distance from the vehicle ahead. A following distance that is too short can easily lead to rear-end collisions when the front vehicle brakes. Conversely, a distance that is too large can result in frequent overtaking by other vehicles, which is also not conducive to driving safety.The distance between vehicles traveling in the same direction primarily depends on the speed of the vehicles, weather conditions, and road surface conditions. Higher speeds, poor visibility, and low road surface adhesion require greater following distances. Under normal weather conditions and on good road surfaces, the following distance mainly depends on speed, with the safe following distance generally equal to the vehicle's speed. 2.Overtaking by Motor Vehicles:(1)Overtaking Rules: When overtaking, a motor vehicle should turn on the left turn signal in advance and alternate between using the high and low beam lights or sound the horn. On roads without a center line or with only one lane for motor vehicles in the same direction, the vehicle in front should, if conditions allow, reduce speed and move to the right to let the vehicle behind pass when it signals to overtake. The overtaking vehicle should ensure it has turned on the right turn signal before returning to the original lane.(2)Situations Where Overtaking Is Prohibited: Overtaking is not allowed in any of the following situations:1)The vehicle in front is making a left turn, a U-turn, or overtaking another vehicle. 2)There is a possibility of a head-on collision with an oncoming vehicle. 3)The vehicle in front is a police car, fire engine, ambulance, or emergency rescue vehicle performing an emergency task. 4)When passing a railway crossing, intersection, narrow bridge, curve, steep slope, tunnel, pedestrian crossing, or road section with heavy urban traffic, where overtaking conditions are not met.

4: Motor Vehicles Passing Through Railway Crossings and Pedestrian Crossings: 1. Motor vehicles passing through railway crossings: 1) When a motor vehicle passes through a railway crossing, it must follow traffic signals or the instructions of traffic management personnel. If there are no traffic signals or traffic management personnel, the vehicle must slow down or stop, and pass only after confirming it is safe. 2) At a railway crossing where the road intersects with the railway at grade, two red lights flashing alternately or a single red light indicates that vehicles and pedestrians are prohibited from passing. When the red light goes off, vehicles and pedestrians are allowed to pass. 2. Motor vehicles yielding to pedestrians crossing the road: 1) When a motor vehicle passes a pedestrian crossing, it must reduce speed. If pedestrians are crossing the pedestrian crossing, the vehicle must stop. 2) When a motor vehicle is traveling on a road without traffic signals, and pedestrians are crossing the road, the vehicle must yield.

5: Motor Vehicle Procedures for Passing, U-Turning, Reversing, Water Crossing, and Ferrying: 1.Passing Another Vehicle: When motor vehicles are passing each other, they should avoid meeting at locations where there are obstacles. The situation where the vehicles, obstacle, and road form a 'three-point line' is unsafe. On roads without central barriers or a center line, vehicles approaching from opposite directions should follow these rules: 1)Reduce Speed and Keep Right: Vehicles should slow down, move to the right side of the road, and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians. 2)Right of Way at Obstacles: On sections of the road with obstacles, the vehicle on the side without the obstacle has the right of way. However, if the vehicle on the side with the obstacle has already entered the section, and the other vehicle has not yet entered, the vehicle with the obstacle has the right of way. 3)Passing on Narrow Sloped Roads: On narrow, sloped roads, the vehicle going uphill has the right of way. However, if the downhill vehicle has already reached the midway point and the uphill vehicle has not yet started ascending, the downhill vehicle has the right of way. 4)Passing on Narrow Mountain Roads: On narrow mountain roads, the vehicle not driving next to the mountain (the one on the outside edge) has the right of way. 2.U-Turning for Motor Vehicles:1)Prohibited U-Turn Locations: Motor vehicles are not allowed to make U-turns at locations where U-turns or left turns are prohibited by signs or road markings. U-turns are also prohibited at railway crossings, pedestrian crossings, bridges, sharp curves, steep slopes, tunnels, or on road sections that pose a risk of danger. 2)Permitted U-Turn Locations: Motor vehicles may make a U-turn at locations where U-turns or left turns are not prohibited by signs or road markings. However, the U-turn must not interfere with the normal passage of other vehicles or pedestrians. 3.Reversing for Motor Vehicles: When reversing, a motor vehicle must check the situation behind the vehicle and ensure it is safe before proceeding. Reversing is prohibited at railway crossings, intersections, one-way streets, bridges, sharp curves, steep slopes, or inside tunnels. 4.Water Crossing for Motor Vehicles: When a motor vehicle approaches a flooded road or bridge, the driver should stop and assess the water conditions. Only after confirming that it is safe should the vehicle proceed at a low speed to cross the water. 5.Ferry Crossing for Motor Vehicles: When approaching a ferry crossing, motor vehicles should follow the instructions of the ferry operators and wait in line at the designated location for their turn to board. When boarding and disembarking the ferry, vehicles should proceed at a low speed and move cautiously.

6: Carrying Loads in Motor Vehicles: 1.Basic Requirements for Carrying Loads in Motor Vehicles: 1)Compliance with Approved Load Capacity: The load carried by a motor vehicle must comply with the approved load capacity. Overloading is strictly prohibited. The length, width, and height of the load must meet the legal loading requirements, and the load must not spill or scatter during transport. 2)Transporting Oversized, Indivisible Items: If a motor vehicle is transporting oversized, indivisible items that could affect traffic safety, the vehicle must travel at the times, routes, and speeds designated by the traffic management department of the public security authorities. The vehicle should also display conspicuous warning signs. 3)Transporting Hazardous Materials: For motor vehicles carrying explosive materials, flammable and explosive chemicals, highly toxic substances, radioactive materials, and other dangerous goods, approval from the public security authorities is required. The vehicle must travel at designated times, routes, and speeds, display warning signs, and implement necessary safety measures. 2.Restrictions on the Length, Width, and Height of Loads in Motor Vehicles: 1)Heavy, Medium Trucks, and Semi-Trailers: The height of the load, measured from the ground, must not exceed 4 meters. For vehicles transporting containers, the height must not exceed 4.2 meters. 2)Other Cargo Vehicles: For other motor vehicles carrying goods, the height of the load, measured from the ground, must not exceed 2.5 meters. 3)Motorcycles: The height of the load, measured from the ground, must not exceed 1.5 meters; The length of the load must not extend more than 0.2 meters beyond the motorcycle's body; For two-wheeled motorcycles, the width of the load must not extend more than 0.15 meters beyond the handlebars on either side, For three-wheeled motorcycles, the width of the load must not exceed the width of the vehicle body. 4)Passenger Vehicles: Passenger vehicles are not allowed to carry cargo, except on external roof racks or in built-in luggage compartments; The height of the load on a roof rack must not exceed 0.5 meters from the roof, and the total height from the ground must not exceed 4 meters.
7: When carrying passengers, motor vehicles must adhere to the following regulations: 1)Passenger Buses on Roads: Passenger buses must not carry more passengers than the approved seating capacity. However, children who are exempt from ticketing according to regulations do not count toward this limit. When the bus is fully occupied, the number of such exempt children must not exceed 10% of the approved seating capacity. 2)Cargo Trucks: The cargo bed of a truck must not be used to carry passengers. However, on urban roads, if there is sufficient space, a cargo truck may temporarily carry 1 to 5 workers in the cargo bed. If the load height exceeds the height of the cargo bed's side panels, no passengers are allowed to ride on top of the cargo. 3)Motorcycles: The rear seat of a motorcycle must not be used to carry minors under the age of 12. Light motorcycles are not allowed to carry passengers at all.
8: Towing Trailers with Motor Vehicles: 1)Cargo Trucks, Semi-Trailer Tractors, and Tractors are allowed to tow only one trailer. The trailer's lighting signals, brakes, connections, and safety protection devices must meet national standards. 2)Small Passenger Vehicles are only allowed to tow either a travel trailer or a trailer with a total mass of less than 700 kg, and the trailer must not carry any passengers. 3)Cargo Trucks must ensure that the load capacity of the trailer being towed does not exceed the load capacity of the truck itself.4)Large and Medium Passenger Vehicles, Low-Speed Cargo Trucks, Three-Wheeled Vehicles, and Other Motor Vehicles are not permitted to tow trailers.
9: Use of Lights in Motor Vehicles: 1.Use of Turn Signals: 1)Left Turn Signal: The left turn signal should be activated in advance when making a left turn, changing lanes to the left, preparing to overtake another vehicle, leaving a parking spot, or making a U-turn. 2)Right Turn Signal: The right turn signal should be activated in advance when making a right turn, changing lanes to the right, returning to the original lane after overtaking, or parking by the roadside. 2.Use of Headlights and Other Lights: Low Visibility Conditions: When driving at night on roads without streetlights, or when lighting is poor, as well as during fog, rain, snow, dust storms, or hail, motor vehicles should turn on the headlights, clearance lights, and tail lights. However, when a vehicle is following another vehicle closely in the same direction, high beams should not be used to avoid dazzling the driver of the vehicle in front. Foggy Conditions: During foggy weather, motor vehicles should turn on the fog lights and hazard warning flashers to increase visibility and alert other road users. 3.Use of Lights and Horn on Complex Road Sections: Alternating Headlights: At night, when passing through sharp curves, sloped roads, arched bridges, pedestrian crossings, or intersections without traffic signals, motor vehicles should alternate between high and low beams to signal their presence to other road users. Horn Use and Speed Reduction: When approaching sharp curves, the crest of a hill, or other sections of the road where visibility is reduced and safety is compromised, as well as when overtaking or in an emergency situation, the vehicle should slow down, drive cautiously, and sound the horn to alert others.

10: Safety Measures for a Broken-Down Vehicle: 1.On-Site Handling of a Broken-Down Vehicle: When a motor vehicle breaks down on the road and needs to stop to address the issue, the driver should immediately turn on the hazard warning flashers and move the vehicle to a location where it does not obstruct traffic. If the vehicle breaks down or is involved in a traffic accident on the road and cannot be moved easily, the driver should turn on the hazard warning flashers as required and place a warning sign 50 to 100 meters behind the vehicle. At night, the clearance lights and tail lights should also be turned on. If necessary, the driver should quickly call the police for assistance. 2.Towing a Broken-Down Vehicle: When towing a broken-down vehicle, the following regulations must be observed: 1)No Passengers or Trailers: The towed vehicle must not carry passengers other than the driver, and it must not tow another trailer. 2)Vehicle Width: The width of the towed vehicle must not exceed the width of the towing vehicle. 3)Soft Towing Connection: When using a soft towing connection (such as a tow rope), the distance between the towing vehicle and the towed vehicle should be greater than 4 meters but less than 10 meters. 4)Braking Failure: If the towed vehicle has a brake failure, a rigid towing connection (such as a tow bar) must be used. 5)Hazard Warning Lights: Both the towing vehicle and the towed vehicle must have their hazard warning flashers turned on during the towing process. 6)Prohibited Vehicles: Crane trucks and wheeled special-purpose vehicles are not allowed to tow other vehicles. Motorcycles are also not permitted to tow other vehicles or be towed by other vehicles.
