1: Safe Driving while Following: 1)Maintain a safe following distance. While driving behind another vehicle, avoid focusing solely on the vehicle directly in front of you; instead, continuously observe the movement of the two to three vehicles ahead. Managing the safe distance between your vehicle and the one in front is crucial for avoiding rear-end collisions and minor accidents.To ensure safety, adhere to the following guidelines: (1)On dry roads: When traveling at speeds between 30 to 60 kilometers per hour, maintain a following distance greater than the speed minus 15. When traveling at speeds exceeding 60 kilometers per hour, maintain a following distance approximately equal to the speed.(2)In rainy conditions: Increase the safe following distance to 1.5 times the distance recommended for dry roads. (3)In icy or snowy conditions: Increase the safe following distance to three times the distance recommended for dry roads. By maintaining these safe following distances, you can ensure that your vehicle has enough space to come to a stop without colliding with the vehicle in front when it brakes.

2: Safe Driving while Following: 2)Hazard assessment and handling when following another vehicle. (1)Prevent sudden stops by the vehicle in front. Pay attention to the driving dynamics of the vehicles ahead and the road conditions. Be alert for situations where the vehicle in front might suddenly stop or if there are issues with its brake lights. Anticipate the possibility of emergency braking by the vehicle in front, maintain a safe distance, and ensure you have enough reaction time to decide whether to change lanes or slow down. (2) Be cautious of abnormal vehicles. If the vehicle ahead exhibits erratic driving behavior, maintain a safe distance behind it, observe closely, and, if safe, attempt to pass the vehicle. Be vigilant for signs of drunk driving, drug impairment, or driver fatigue. (3) Pay attention to signal light changes when following large vehicles. Large vehicles ahead can obstruct visibility, making it difficult to see traffic signals or roadside signs. Increase the following distance to expand your field of vision, preventing sudden changes in traffic signals when following large vehicles, and avoiding rear-ending them in case of emergency braking. (4) If the vehicle behind is following too closely, lightly tap the brake pedal to signal to the driver behind. You don't need to apply heavy pressure, just enough to activate the brake lights. If signaling doesn't work and the vehicle behind continues to tailgate, consider signaling to the right and yielding to let the vehicle pass.

3: Safe Driving when Changing Lanes: When driving a vehicle and needing to change lanes for overtaking, avoiding obstacles, turning, making a U-turn, or parking, it's important to analyze the traffic flow on the road, select the appropriate lane, and choose the right moment to change lanes safely. 1)The 'Two-Step Lane Change Method': To ensure safety when changing lanes, drivers can use the 'two-step lane change method.' The specific steps are as follows: Two observations: 1. Before changing lanes, activate the turn signal for at least 3 seconds to indicate intention, then check the rearview and side mirrors to observe the traffic behind and the conditions of the lane to be entered. 2. There are blind spots on the sides of vehicles, so after confirming the safety ahead, it's necessary to glance sideways again to check for any vehicles in the lane being entered. Two lane changes: 1. When it's safe from the side and rear, gradually move the vehicle closer to the lane to be changed without obstructing the normal flow of traffic in that lane. 2. Sometimes, the vehicle behind may accelerate aggressively to prevent lane change. In such cases, if it's safe, retreat to the original lane. If the vehicle behind has no intention to overtake, confirm safety again and complete the lane change, then turn off the turn signal. During the lane change process, also pay attention to: (1) Avoid changing lanes consecutively more than twice. (2) When vehicles from both the left and right sides intend to change lanes into the same lane, the vehicle on the left should yield to the one on the right. (3) On road sections with dashed and solid lane dividing lines, changing lanes from the side with solid lines is strictly prohibited. (4) Lane changes should not be too slow; driving long distances on lane markings can affect other vehicles' movement. Generally, aim to change lanes at a distance of 50 to 60 meters. (5) Each lane change involves inherent risks, so frequent lane changes are prohibited. 2)Changing Lanes While Turning. When changing lanes before making a left or right turn, drivers should follow the directional arrows and change lanes in the dashed line area. Once entering the solid line area, lane changes should not be made. Drivers should safely change lanes in the following sequence: observe the rear situation through the rearview mirror, then through the left or right side mirrors to observe the rear vehicle's driving conditions, check the blind spots by turning the head, and finally, after confirming safety, change lanes. When changing lanes before making a left turn, pay attention to the speed and distance of vehicles in the left rear, determining whether to accelerate or decelerate the lane change. When changing lanes before making a right turn, fully utilize the rearview mirror and side glance to confirm safety in the right rear before changing lanes and turning right. When turning right, pay special attention to pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles on the right to avoid collisions. 2)Changing Lanes While Turning.

4: Driving Straight Through Intersections: 1)Passing through intersections with traffic signals. When driving a motor vehicle through an intersection controlled by traffic signals, reduce speed and proceed with caution while observing traffic conditions to the left and right. When the red light (or red arrow) is illuminated, stop behind the intersection's stop line and wait for the green light. When waiting at the intersection, it's best to stop about 1-2 meters before the stop line; maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front and remain vigilant of surrounding traffic movements. When proceeding straight through an intersection with a green light, if there are vehicles making left turns from the opposite direction, promptly reduce speed and yield to them, avoiding attempting to pass through hastily. When the yellow light is illuminated, vehicles that have already crossed the stop line can continue to proceed; those that have not crossed the stop line must not accelerate to pass through, but rather stop outside the stop line and wait. When passing through intersections with arrow signal lights, pay attention to the direction indicated by the signal lights. When the green arrow signal corresponding to your lane is illuminated, you may proceed. 2)Passing through intersections without traffic signals. When proceeding straight through an intersection without traffic signals, start to slow down about 50-100 meters before reaching the intersection. As you approach the intersection, carefully observe the traffic conditions on the roads to the left and right, reduce speed, or come to a complete stop to look around. Adhere to the principle of 'look, slow down, and then proceed.' Vehicles proceeding straight have the right of way. When encountering a sign indicating 'yield,' stop to observe the main road conditions and proceed only when it is safe to do so. Be attentive to yield to vehicles and pedestrians already crossing the intersection, and be prepared to stop at any time. Even with the right of way, do not ignore the danger posed by oncoming vehicles attempting to make left turns or vehicles in adjacent lanes attempting to pass through. When encountering a sign indicating 'slow down,' reduce speed and proceed slowly. At intersections where pedestrians are crossing without using a crosswalk, promptly reduce speed and stop to yield, without attempting to pass through by accelerating and maneuvering around pedestrians.

5: Turning at intersections: 1)Left Turn at Intersections: When driving a motor vehicle and making a left turn at an intersection with directional arrows, change lanes to the left in advance according to the direction indicated by the arrow. When changing lanes, pay attention to the situation in the lane ahead and to the left, and ensure that it does not affect the passage of vehicles in the left lane. At intersections controlled by traffic lights, advance into the left turn lane or drive close to the left side of the road, waiting for the signal to turn green. At intersections with a left-turn waiting area line, enter the waiting area when the straight green light is on. 2)Right Turn at Intersections: When driving a motor vehicle and making a right turn at an intersection, pay attention to the traffic conditions behind and in the direction of the right turn, as well as the vehicles and pedestrians turning right. When making a right turn at an intersection with a red light, you can slow down and turn right on the right side, but you should not affect the passage of other vehicles and pedestrians in the direction being cleared.

6: Passing Through Complex Intersections: (1)When passing through complex intersections, drive at a low speed, yield to pedestrians and vehicles with the right of way as required, and be prepared to stop at any time. Do not accelerate through the intersection.(2)Exercise extra caution when passing through intersections with poor visibility to anticipate unexpected situations that may arise within blind spots. When encountering other vehicles illegally changing lanes at intersections, promptly reduce speed and yield to maintain safe passage.(3)In the event of intersection congestion, even if the traffic light is green, wait outside the intersection rather than entering or stopping within it. This helps prevent further congestion or being trapped in the middle of the intersection.(4)When driving through complex intersections with heavy traffic, reduce speed and observe the flow of vehicles within the intersection, being prepared to stop and yield when necessary.

7: Passing through roundabout intersections: (1)Roundabouts are accident-prone areas. When passing through, slow down and control your speed appropriately about 50 to 100 meters before reaching the roundabout. Enter the roundabout counterclockwise, paying attention to the dynamics of vehicles already inside the roundabout on your left. Merge into the traffic flow when appropriate and be prepared to slow down or stop if necessary.(2)Before exiting the roundabout, activate your right turn signal and observe the dynamics of vehicles and pedestrians on your right side. When exiting a roundabout with two or more lanes, switch to the outer lane by activating your right turn signal in advance. Directly exiting from the inner lane is strictly prohibited.

8: Passing through an overpass: The forms of overpasses are diverse, and a slight lack of attention or relying solely on past experience while driving can often lead to taking the wrong route. When passing through an overpass, it's important to note the following:(1)When approaching the overpass, slow down appropriately to ensure there's enough time to accurately identify the direction of the exit.(2)When going straight, maintain your original direction either on the bridge or under it, and be mindful to yield the right-of-way to vehicles exiting or entering from the right lane.(3)When making a right turn, reduce speed according to the indications of traffic signs and markings, and use the exit ramp to complete the right turn.(4)For left turns, you must cross the bridge before making the turn and cannot directly turn left. Signal right, cross the bridge, then turn right once or twice before reaching your desired left turn.(5)Observe the speed limit signs and markings while crossing the overpass.(6)If you realize you've chosen the wrong route while on the overpass, continue to the next overpass or intersection where U-turns are permitted. Do not attempt to make an immediate U-turn or reverse to change routes.

9: Passing through a railway crossing: (1)At railway crossings controlled by traffic signals, drivers should slow down and gear down before reaching the crossing. Follow the signals and proceed at a low speed as indicated. Do not change gears while crossing the railway. Stop and wait if the alarm sounds or if the red light is on. Crossing the railway when the red light is on is strictly prohibited.(2)At railway crossings without traffic signals or attendants, drivers should stop before the crossing, observe left and right for approaching trains, and only proceed after ensuring it's safe. Follow the 'Stop, Look, and Listen' rule: stop before the stop line, look both ways for approaching trains, and then proceed slowly after confirming safety.(3)When crossing double-track railway crossings, after a train passes from one side, drivers should also be cautious of trains approaching from the other direction. If there is any danger, immediately stop at a safe location and wait; do not attempt to force through.(4)When following other vehicles through a railway crossing, drivers should observe the leading vehicle's actions. Only proceed when there's enough space on the other side of the crossing for your vehicle to stop safely. Do not stop inside the crossing. If traffic is congested ahead, even if the traffic signal allows passage, do not enter to avoid collision with a train.(5)If a vehicle breaks down at a railway crossing, drivers should promptly attempt to move the vehicle out of the crossing. If it's difficult to move the vehicle out immediately, try to notify approaching trains first, and then promptly move the vehicle out as soon as possible.

10: Crossing pedestrian crossings: The pedestrian crossing line is a marking set up on the road to provide a safe passage for pedestrians crossing the road, often referred to as the 'lifeline.' When drivers approach a pedestrian crossing, they should reduce speed, observe, and yield to pedestrians. (1)When approaching a pedestrian crossing line, drivers should reduce speed in advance and observe carefully. Pay attention to pedestrians on both sides of the pedestrian crossing and be prepared to stop and yield to them at any time. When pedestrians or non-motor vehicles are crossing the pedestrian crossing, drivers should stop promptly and yield, without attempting to overtake or bypass them. Extra caution should be exercised when making right turns to yield to pedestrians crossing the pedestrian crossing.(2)If you see vehicles stopped in front of a pedestrian crossing, make sure to stop as well. Do not pass blindly as the leading vehicle may be stopping to give way to pedestrians. Avoid overtaking or changing lanes directly on or near pedestrian crossings, especially watching out for pedestrians who may be moving slowly and might still be on the crossing.

11: Crossing school zones: (1)When driving near schools or on roads marked with signs indicating children, be sure to reduce speed promptly, observe both sides of the road and the surrounding area, and remain vigilant for students crossing the road.(2)When driving in school zones during school hours, always be prepared to yield to students and children crossing the road. If you encounter students or children crossing, come to a timely stop to give way. Do not attempt to pass through the middle of them or go around from either side to avoid accidents.(3)When you see parents or adults signaling from the roadside, reduce your speed promptly, stay observant, and be prepared to stop at any moment to prevent students or children from suddenly crossing the road towards them.

12: Crossing bus stops: (1)When passing a bus stop, reduce speed in advance, watch for the movements of people waiting at the station, avoid using the bus lane, and refrain from parking within 30 meters of the bus stop.(2)When overtaking vehicles stopped at the bus stop, slow down, maintain a significant safety distance from the bus, anticipate passengers crossing the road in front of or behind the bus, and be attentive to pedestrians crossing in front of or behind buses traveling in the opposite direction. Be prepared to stop at any time.(3)When driving a motor vehicle at a bus stop and encountering a stopped bus or non-motor vehicles overtaking the bus, drive at a low speed, maintain a significant safety distance, and anticipate the possibility of sudden acceleration of the bus or sudden falls of non-motor vehicles.

13: Crossing residential areas: (1)When passing through residential areas, adhere to the speed limit signs, drive at a low speed, and remain vigilant about the surroundings at all times. In the event of sudden situations, stop and yield the right of way, refrain from continuously honking the horn as a warning, or attempting to accelerate and overtake.(2)When driving through residential areas, be attentive to pedestrians. If pedestrians are present on both sides or occupying the roadway, maintain a safe distance and drive at a low speed. Wait for pedestrians to yield before proceeding.(3)When encountering non-motor vehicles crossing the road within the residential area, promptly reduce speed and yield the right of way. Do not attempt to accelerate past non-motor vehicles from either the front or the rear.(4)When encountering children playing by the roadside in residential areas, pay close attention to their movements, and proceed with caution by reducing speed.

14: Safe driving during meeting: (1)When meeting on roads without a central divider or centerline, slow down and keep to the right, maintaining a safe lateral distance from the oncoming vehicle. If the chosen meeting position is not ideal, reduce speed promptly, pass slowly, or stop to yield.(2)On roads with a centerline, observe the traffic on both sides. If the oncoming vehicle crosses the centerline or signals intent to overtake, immediately slow down or stop to yield on the right side of the road.(3)When meeting at locations with obstacles, observe the situation on the opposite side. If the oncoming vehicle is approaching the obstacle, stop promptly to allow the oncoming vehicle to pass first, then proceed to pass the obstacle.(4)When meeting, if the oncoming vehicle attempts to overtake by accelerating, correctly assess the safe distance, slow down, or stop to yield, safely giving way to the oncoming vehicle. Avoid competing for the lane or attempting to pass to prevent collisions.(5)When meeting on narrow roads, reduce speed according to the width of the road, maintaining a sufficient lateral safety distance between the two vehicles. After passing, carefully observe from the rearview mirror to ensure no vehicles are overtaking before gradually returning to the normal driving lane. If meeting presents difficulties, the party with the better conditions for yielding should give way first. If there is a wider section of road ahead, the vehicle arriving there first should yield.(6)When meeting on narrow inclines, downhill vehicles should yield to uphill vehicles. If the downhill vehicle has reached halfway while the uphill vehicle has yet to ascend, the downhill vehicle should proceed first. On narrow mountain roads, the vehicle closer to the mountainside should yield.(7)During rainy weather or when encountering flooded roads, promptly activate windshield wipers and be prepared to brake to prevent water splashes from hindering visibility. Maintain a certain lateral distance from oncoming vehicles, preferring to let water splash on the side of the vehicle rather than on the front windshield to avoid obstructing visibility.

15: Safe driving during overtaking: When overtaking, maintain a safe distance from the vehicle being overtaken, observe the traffic on the left side, choose an appropriate moment, activate the left turn signal, and overtake from the left side of the vehicle being passed. After overtaking, gradually return to the original lane without affecting the normal driving of the vehicle being passed. When overtaking, it's important to be mindful of the following situations:(1)Before overtaking non-motorized vehicles, if they suddenly stop and obstruct the lane, slowing down to let them proceed first is necessary.(2)Overtaking is prohibited when approaching intersections, railway crossings, tunnels, bends, narrow roads, narrow bridges, or when the vehicle ahead is turning left, overtaking, or making a U-turn.(3)When overtaking vehicles parked on the right side, to prevent sudden starts or opening of doors, the most effective approach is to maintain a lateral safe distance and reduce speed. Honking continuously, accelerating through, or maintaining normal speed won't prevent sudden dangers.(4)If the driver notices signals from the vehicle behind indicating an intention to overtake, and if conditions permit, promptly activate the right turn signal, reduce speed, move to the right, and if necessary, use hand signals to indicate yielding space for overtaking. Intentionally refusing to yield or yielding slowly is not allowed.(5)When a vehicle from behind forcefully overtakes and attempts to change lanes to the right without leaving a safe distance, slowing down or moving to the right to stop and yield is necessary. Absolutely do not retaliate by driving recklessly.

16: Safe U-turn: 1)Selection of U-turn location.(1)Based on road conditions or traffic conditions, choose a safe section for U-turning that does not hinder the normal passage of vehicles and pedestrians, as well as sections with low traffic flow, wide roads, and where the U-turn can be completed in one go.(2)U-turns are not allowed in the following sections: sharp bends, roads with no U-turn signs, railway crossings, steep slopes, narrow bridges, tunnels, dangerous sections, and pedestrian crossings. 2)U-turn methods.(1)When making a U-turn at a location or intersection with median barriers allowing U-turns, you should activate your left turn signal in advance. Without obstructing the normal flow of other vehicles, change lanes to the left side as indicated by traffic signs and complete the U-turn. Maintain a strict control of your speed during the U-turn and carefully observe the traffic dynamics on the road to ensure safe passage.(2)When making a U-turn on road segments without median barriers allowing U-turns, carefully observe the traffic conditions on the road. If necessary, stop and observe. Only when you confirm there are no vehicles or pedestrians passing by in front or behind your vehicle, activate your turn signal and make the U-turn without disrupting the normal flow of other vehicles.(3)During each forward or backward movement of the U-turn, carefully observe the traffic conditions behind and on both sides of your vehicle and ensure safety. Pay close attention to the distance between the front and rear ends of your vehicle and obstacles on the road to prevent accidents.

17: Safe reversing: (1)When reversing on regular roads, avoid busy traffic, areas with many cyclists and pedestrians, and narrow road sections.(2)Before reversing, carefully observe the reversing route and only proceed with the maneuver when safe conditions are confirmed. During the reversing process, drive slowly, pay attention to the situation on both sides and behind the vehicle, and always be aware of the safe space around the front of the vehicle. Be prepared to stop at any time to avoid accidents caused by excessive turning angles. Even if the road conditions behind are favorable, do not accelerate while reversing.(3)When reversing, if there are passing vehicles, proactively stop and yield. When reversing for a U-turn, choose a location where other vehicles and pedestrians are not affected by the maneuver.

18: Safe parking: (1)Parking should be chosen in areas or locations that do not obstruct traffic and do not have signs or markings prohibiting parking. Parking is not permitted in areas with signs or markings prohibiting parking.(2)After parking, the parking brake lever should be pulled first, then release the foot brake pedal, and turn off the engine. First, observe the traffic situation to the side, rear, and left, and when it is safe, slowly open the car door to avoid obstructing other vehicles and pedestrians when opening the door.(3)When multiple vehicles are parking nearby, they should park in sequence along the right side of the road, maintaining an appropriate longitudinal distance, and not parking side by side with other vehicles. When temporarily parking on urban streets, vehicles should be parked at designated locations, and parking side by side or parking in reverse is not allowed.(4)When temporarily parking on the roadside, it should not obstruct the passage of other motor vehicles and pedestrians. At night or in windy, rainy, snowy, or foggy weather when temporarily parking on the side of the road, turn off the headlights, turn on the clearance lights and hazard warning flashers. After the driver exits the vehicle, close the doors and do not move far from the vehicle. If obstructing traffic, promptly drive away.(5)When parking for an extended period, choose a parking lot or a location that permits long-term parking, and park in the designated areas in sequence. For long-term parking, try to park in a garage. Parking is not allowed on carriageways, sidewalks, or areas with signs prohibiting long-term parking.

19: Driving in rainy weather: The main factors affecting safe driving in rainy weather are obstructed visibility and slippery road surfaces. Raindrops can blur the front windshield and rearview mirrors, while water mist splashed up by preceding vehicles seriously affects visibility. Wet road surfaces not only reflect light but also make vehicles prone to skidding, so it's essential to control speed reasonably in rainy conditions. Additionally, rainwater can lead to changes in road conditions. During prolonged periods of rain, it's important to watch out for loosened roadbeds or collapses and choose safe routes. In mountainous areas near hillsides, special attention should be paid to potential landslides caused by rain.
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "raining"}, "action": {"Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 40, "limit_speed": false}, "State_action": {"target": "fog_light", "whether_turn_on": true}}}', name='UDrive')

20: Driving in rainy weather: Correct use of windshield wipers——Before it starts raining, drivers should check if the windshield wipers are working properly and if they effectively clear water. If any issues are detected, prompt maintenance is necessary. While driving in rainy conditions, drivers should select the appropriate wiper speed based on the intensity of the rainfall to ensure clear visibility. In cases of heavy rain or storms where visibility remains poor despite the use of wipers, it's advisable to find a safe location to pull over. Turn on hazard lights and position lights until the rain subsides or stops before continuing the journey.

21: Driving in rainy weather: Reasonably controlling vehicle speed——When driving in rainy conditions, the road surface becomes slippery, and the traction of the tires decreases sharply with the increase of vehicle speed, making the vehicle prone to skidding. Even at high speeds, vehicles are susceptible to hydroplaning. Therefore, it is essential to control the speed properly. When the vehicle experiences skidding or hydroplaning, avoid sudden steering or emergency braking. Instead, release the accelerator pedal and utilize engine braking to decelerate. It's worth noting that at the onset of rain, the road surface is most prone to skidding.

22: Driving in rainy weather: Maintain a safe distance——When driving in rainy conditions, it's crucial to select a safe driving speed and maintain an adequate distance from other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. When encountering pedestrians and cyclists, reduce speed in advance, sound the horn, and pass at a safe distance, avoiding rushing past or abruptly accelerating beside them. Keep a close eye on the movements of pedestrians and cyclists to anticipate sudden turns or slips as vehicles approach, and avoid splashing water onto them. When driving in rainy conditions, it's important to increase the following distance behind the preceding vehicle and avoid overtaking whenever possible to reduce the risk of accidents.

23: Driving in snowy conditions: Driving in snowy conditions presents several challenges, including increased resistance due to snow accumulation on the road surface and reduced visibility. Additionally, when snow melts and refreezes, it forms a layer of ice, making the road extremely slippery. Therefore, when driving on snowy or icy roads, it's essential to increase your following distance and drive at a slower speed. This allows for better control of your vehicle and gives you more time to react to changing road conditions.
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"in": "icy_road"}, "condition": {"weather_is": "snowing"}, "action": {"Dynamic_Obstacle_Follow_distance": 50, "Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 30}}}', name='UDrive')

24: Driving in snowy conditions: Choosing a driving route——When driving on snow-covered roads, to prevent glare caused by snow reflection, drivers can wear sunglasses. When the road surface is covered with snow or road contours are difficult to distinguish, drivers can use reference points such as roadside trees or utility poles to judge the driving route and control the vehicle at a low speed. On roads with existing tracks, it's advisable to drive at a low speed following the tracks. When driving in hazardous areas like bends, slopes, or valleys, it's essential to carefully choose the driving route. If the road conditions seem suspicious, drivers should immediately stop, check, and only proceed when it's confirmed safe. When driving on icy or snowy roads, drivers should avoid sudden braking and sharp steering maneuvers.

25: Driving in snowy conditions: Reduce speed while driving——When driving on icy or snowy roads, if conditions allow, install anti-skid chains. Drive slowly in a low gear to avoid emergency braking and sudden steering to prevent the vehicle from slipping off the road surface. If the vehicle starts to skid, immediately and gently steer the wheel in the direction of the rear-wheel skid. Repeat this maneuver several times to regain control of the vehicle. When driving in snowy conditions, maintain a significant distance from the vehicle in front to allow for safe braking distances. In emergencies, avoid using abrupt braking or steering maneuvers; instead, utilize engine braking to slow down or stop gradually. If following a vehicle uphill, refrain from closely tailgating or overtaking until the vehicle ahead has cleared the peak. This precaution helps prevent accidents caused by sudden stops or sliding backward.

26: Driving in fog or haze: In foggy (hazy) weather, visibility is low, causing the driver's line of sight to be blurred, the visual distance to shorten, and the field of vision to narrow. In dense fog, it is difficult to discern direction, and it is challenging to see obstacles ahead (such as slow-moving vehicles, pedestrians, stalled cars, potholes, etc.), which can lead to traffic accidents.
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "foggy"}, "action": {"State_action": {"target": "fog_light", "whether_turn_on": true}, "Expected_speed": {"speed_number": 30}}}', name='UDrive')

27: Driving in fog or haze: Correct use of lights and horn——Correct use of lights and horn in foggy weather: When driving in foggy conditions, you should turn on the fog lights and position lights to ensure that other drivers can see your vehicle. In heavy fog, you can use low-beam headlights to illuminate the road ahead, while also activating the hazard warning lights. Avoid using high beams in foggy conditions. If there are small water droplets on the windshield, you can use the windshield wipers to clear them. The interior fog can be cleared using the defogging function of the windshield or by stopping in a safe location and wiping it dry with a towel. When parking in foggy conditions, always activate the hazard warning lights. When driving on roads in foggy conditions, it's advisable to use the horn more frequently to alert oncoming vehicles. If you hear the horn of an oncoming vehicle, you should respond by honking your horn as well.

28: Driving in fog or haze: Reducing speed and increasing the safe distance——Driving in foggy conditions requires keeping your speed within a range where you can stop in time, maintaining an adequate safe distance, and proceeding cautiously and slowly. You can also use your horn more frequently to alert pedestrians and other vehicles. When visibility is significantly reduced due to fog, it's advisable to pull over to a safe roadside area or a parking lot and wait until visibility improves before resuming driving. If driving in fog becomes unavoidable, adjust your speed based on the visibility conditions. Choose a speed where you can stop quickly if needed, ensuring that your sight distance exceeds your braking distance. When driving in foggy conditions, it's important to anticipate and prevent the following risks:(1)In foggy conditions, it's easy to mistake the brake lights of stationary vehicles ahead for the taillights of moving vehicles, leading to rear-end collisions. Therefore, it's crucial to closely monitor the movements of the vehicle in front, control your speed strictly, and increase the safety distance between vehicles.(2)When encountering oncoming traffic, choose wide sections of the road to reduce speed and maintain sufficient lateral spacing. Sound the horn appropriately. If the oncoming vehicle is approaching quickly, slow down voluntarily or pull over to the side.(3)Avoid blindly overtaking when the vehicle in front is driving close to the right side of the road, as it may be maneuvering to avoid oncoming traffic.

29: Driving in windy conditions: Steadying your direction——In windy conditions, where wind speed and direction are constantly changing, drivers often experience a sensation of the steering wheel being suddenly 'grabbed.' At such times, it's essential to grip the steering wheel firmly with both hands. When hit by a sudden gust of wind that causes lateral movement of the vehicle, reduce your speed and gently adjust the steering wheel to correct the vehicle's heading. Avoid making abrupt steering maneuvers to regain control of the vehicle's direction.

30: Driving in windy conditions: Observe the distance ahead——Strong winds can stir up dust and affect visibility for drivers. Additionally, they can carry debris like sand, broken branches, or toppled signs, posing a threat to vehicle windows and the safety of occupants. Hence, it's crucial for drivers to remain vigilant and observe conditions in the distance.
Function(arguments='{"trigger": {"always": true}, "condition": {"weather_is": "sandstorm"}, "action": {"Check_distance": 50}}', name='UDrive')

31: Mountainous road driving: Driving on slopes or inclines——When driving on mountain roads, pay attention to observing and identifying hill warning signs in advance. When ascending, observe the road conditions, the length and gradient of the slope. Downshift before the vehicle's speed decreases to ensure that the vehicle has sufficient power to climb the slope, avoiding downshifting or stalling halfway up the slope. When ascending a steep slope, downshift and accelerate at the bottom of the slope. When approaching the top of a slope and unable to see the road ahead clearly, slow down and honk the horn to signal, do not accelerate over the crest to prevent collisions with oncoming vehicles or other unexpected situations. When descending, shift to a lower gear to make full use of engine braking to control the vehicle speed, and it is strictly forbidden to coast in neutral gear. During prolonged or continuous downhill driving, the vehicle speed may increase. Continuous use of the brakes can cause the brake temperature to rise to a certain extent, leading to a sharp decrease in braking effectiveness. The best way to control speed when descending is to use a lower gear and utilize engine braking for deceleration.

33: Mountainous road driving: Driving on sections of roads that combine curves and slopes——In mountainous areas, roads often feature sections where curves and slopes coincide, creating challenging combinations known as curve-slope segments. These segments are prone to accidents, requiring drivers to exercise extra caution and control over their speed. (1)When encountering a sharp curve on an uphill slope, it's important to reduce speed and downshift at the bottom of the slope to maintain enough power to climb all the way to the top without shifting gears. Before entering the curve, slow down appropriately, keep to the right, and signal with the horn as a gesture. If the road surface is narrow, continuously monitor the oncoming traffic and be prepared to stop at any time.(2)When facing a series of downhill curves, it's crucial to slow down and downshift in advance. Through each curve, it's necessary to reduce speed appropriately, keep to the right, and avoid drifting towards the center of the road for better visibility.

34: Mountainous road driving: Following, Overtaking, Meeting——In mountainous areas, when following another vehicle, it's important to maintain an appropriate distance and carefully observe the movements of the vehicle ahead. In areas with poor visibility or challenging road conditions, it's necessary to further increase the following distance to prevent accidents in case the vehicle ahead suddenly stops or slides after stopping. When driving on mountain roads, it's best to avoid overtaking whenever possible. If overtaking is necessary, choose sections of the road that are wide and have a gentle incline. Activate your left turn signal, honk your horn in advance, and only overtake after ensuring that the vehicle ahead is allowing you to pass. Never attempt to overtake forcefully, and strictly refrain from overtaking on narrow roads, sharp curves, continuous bends, or sections with oncoming traffic. If the vehicle ahead obstructs your view or raises dust, causing poor visibility, do not overtake blindly; instead, maintain a significant safety distance. When encountering vehicles on mountain roads, it's advisable to choose wider sections of the road whenever possible. Slow down proactively and select safe spots to reduce speed or stop for passing. If an oncoming vehicle is traveling at high speed or driving near the center of the road, reduce your speed and keep to the right side, avoiding acceleration or driving towards the center to prevent collisions. In narrow mountain road encounters, courteous behavior is crucial:(1)In narrower mountain road encounters, the vehicle closer to the mountain should yield.(2)On narrow uphill roads, the vehicle ascending should yield; however, if the descending vehicle has already reached midway while the ascending vehicle hasn't started climbing, the descending vehicle should yield.

35: Mountainous road driving: Driving on dangerous road sections——When driving a motor vehicle through dangerous road sections near mountains or cliffs, it's important to drive slowly and keep to the right side. On narrow roads close to the mountain side, try to drive as close to the right side as possible at a low speed. When encountering oncoming traffic, choose a safe spot and yield to the other vehicle, prioritizing yielding, slowing down, and stopping first. When driving on the cliff side, keep to the right but try to stay away from the edge of the road. Avoid focusing on the cliff edge. If a vehicle on the mountain side doesn't yield, slow down in advance and choose a safe place to yield. When passing through mountainous areas prone to falling rocks, landslides, or mudslides, drive slowly, stay vigilant, pass through as quickly as possible, and avoid stopping.

36: Mountainous road driving: Tunnel driving——In mountainous areas, tunnels on ordinary roads are generally narrow, dark, and often have moist road surfaces. When entering or exiting tunnels, drivers experience an adjustment period for their eyes to adapt to the changing light conditions. Therefore, it's essential to use lighting effectively and control your speed when passing through tunnels. (1)When passing through narrow tunnels where only one vehicle can pass at a time, you should reduce speed in advance, turn on your headlights, and observe if there are any oncoming vehicles. After confirming it's safe, proceed through the tunnel. If you notice an oncoming vehicle, pull over to the right side of the tunnel and yield, allowing the approaching vehicle to pass before entering the tunnel. When encountering tunnels controlled by traffic signals, strictly adhere to the rules of stopping at red lights and proceeding at green lights.(2)When entering a two-way tunnel, turn on your low beam headlights, drive on the right side, and be attentive to oncoming traffic. When encountering vehicles from the opposite direction, increase the lateral distance and proceed at a safe speed for a secure passing. Do not use high beam headlights when meeting oncoming traffic.(3)While driving inside a two-way tunnel, increase the lateral distance when passing other vehicles, and refrain from using high beam headlights during these encounters. Note: It's advisable to avoid using the horn as much as possible inside tunnels.

37: Mountainous road driving: Mountain road parking——In mountainous areas, it's best to avoid stopping whenever possible. However, if stopping is necessary, choose a level stretch of road and pull over to the right side. If a vehicle needs to stop temporarily due to a breakdown or other reasons on an uphill section with a curb, to prevent the vehicle from rolling backward, turn the steering wheel to the left. Conversely, on a downhill section, turn the steering wheel to the right to prevent the vehicle from rolling forward. This aims to utilize the curb to block the vehicle from rolling. If a vehicle cannot be stopped for an extended period on an uphill section due to a breakdown, place triangular wooden blocks or stones behind the wheels to prevent the vehicle from rolling backward. Similarly, if stopping for a long time on a downhill section, place triangular wooden blocks or stones in front of the wheels to prevent the vehicle from rolling forward.

38: Driving on muddy roads: Low-speed uniform driving——On muddy roads, the road surface is particularly soft and sticky, causing high resistance to vehicle movement and making the wheels prone to slipping or skidding. Therefore, when approaching muddy road sections, it's important to stop and assess the road conditions. Try to choose flat, solid, or rutted sections to pass through. Generally, use low to medium gear for driving, grip the steering wheel firmly, maintain steady pressure on the accelerator pedal, and pass through in one go at a uniform speed. Try to avoid using the brakes to prevent the vehicle from sliding.

39: Driving on muddy roads: Dealing with skidding and getting stuck——When a vehicle skids on muddy roads, gently release the accelerator pedal and simultaneously turn the steering wheel in the direction of the rear wheels' skid to correct it. It's important not to abruptly jerk the steering wheel or apply emergency brakes. If the vehicle becomes stuck in mud and cannot move forward, the first step is to slightly reverse the vehicle, then change the direction of the wheels and engage a low gear to utilize the engine's power to drive out. If the wheels continue to slip, stop immediately, remove the mud or find a way to support the wheels. You can increase the traction of the wheels by using materials like straw, gravel, or wrapping ropes around the driving wheels. After enhancing the wheels' grip, attempt to drive out again.

40: Driving on flooded roads: Ascertain water conditions——During driving through flooded areas, the buoyancy of the water and the impact of the flowing water can limit the vehicle's traction and potentially cause electrical equipment to short circuit due to moisture. Therefore, when encountering flooded roads, it's important to stop and assess the situation, including the depth of the water, the speed of the flow, and the condition of the riverbed. It's not advisable to risk driving through floodwaters. When driving through water, particularly deep water, it's crucial to reduce speed, avoid staring at changes in water flow, and refrain from stopping midway. After driving through water, intermittently press the brake pedal to restore braking efficiency.

43: Crossing bridges: Crossing a major river bridge——When crossing major bridges over rivers, seas, or oceans, you may encounter crosswinds. It's essential to control your steering carefully and adhere to the posted speed limits to prevent the vehicle from veering due to crosswinds. Additionally, when driving on bridges in winter after rain or snow, be cautious of potential ice formation or residual snow on the bridge surface. Drive at a reduced speed to avoid dangers like skidding and loss of control. Note: Bridge surfaces may freeze earlier than regular road surfaces in winter, so slowing down is crucial to prevent skidding.

44: Passing through construction zones: Construction zones often feature narrow road surfaces, increased traffic, and complex traffic conditions. It's crucial to control your speed and drive cautiously when passing through these areas to ensure your safety and the safety of others on the road. (1)When driving through a construction zone, it's crucial to pay attention to traffic signals, control your speed in advance, maintain a safe distance, and keep your direction steady. Follow the instructions of traffic police or construction workers directing traffic; in their absence, strictly adhere to the guidance provided by corresponding signs, markings, and work zone indicators.(2)If the number of lanes on your side is reduced due to construction, change lanes early and maintain orderly traffic flow during congestion. Do not attempt to cut in line. When traveling on a road with only one lane in each direction and your side's lane is closed for construction, and you need to use the opposite lane, reduce your speed, yield to oncoming traffic, and do not attempt to cut in.(3)When passing through a construction zone at night, pay attention to lighting signals, slow down in advance, and if necessary, stop to inspect the road conditions for safety before proceeding. Do not proceed recklessly.

45: Driving at night: When driving at night, drivers are affected by vehicle conditions, environmental factors, and their own physiological characteristics, leading to decreased visual acuity, shorter sight distance, and narrower field of vision. Additionally, observation and judgment capabilities are diminished, making nighttime a high-risk period for traffic accidents. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully observe, control speed appropriately, and use lights correctly when driving at night.

46: Driving at night: Using vehicle lights correctly——At night, vehicle lights serve both illumination and signaling purposes, and they should be used correctly based on the actual driving conditions:(1)As dusk approaches, it's advisable to turn on your headlights in advance. This enhances your visibility to other road users and helps you see obstacles or hazards on the road more clearly.;(2)Before starting to drive at night, it's essential to switch on your low beam headlights. Take the time to carefully observe the surrounding vehicles and road conditions. Once you've confirmed it's safe to proceed, you can start driving. When coming to a stop, ensure your vehicle is fully stationary before turning off your lights.

47: Driving at night: Recognizing and judging road conditions——During nighttime driving, a driver's visibility is limited to the illuminated area by the headlights, making it difficult to observe conditions beyond that range. Therefore, drivers should control their speed appropriately. Additionally, they can recognize and judge road conditions by observing changes in the position of the illuminated area produced by their headlights. (1)When the distance illuminated by the headlights decreases, the road ahead may involve entering a curved section with a barrier or hillside on one side, reaching a low point in a slope, or approaching or entering an incline.(2)When the distance illuminated by the headlights increases, the road ahead may involve a curved section transitioning to a straight road, entering a downhill slope, or transitioning from a gentle downhill slope to a steep one, or moving from a downhill slope to a flat road.(3)When the headlights no longer illuminate the road surface, the road ahead may involve a sharp turn, a large pothole, or reaching the peak of a slope.(4)When the headlights shift from illuminating the center of the road to the roadside, the road ahead may involve a normal curve or a series of curves. In the case of a series of curves, the headlights will shift from one side of the road to the other as the curves progress.

48: Driving at night: Following, overtaking, meeting, and parking——When driving behind another vehicle at night, use low beam headlights, maintain a safe distance, and pay attention to changes in the leading vehicle's signal lights. Be prepared to slow down or stop at any time. Do not use high beam headlights when following another vehicle, and be cautious of pedestrians crossing suddenly from dark areas at the roadside. Before meeting another vehicle at night, switch to low beam headlights when they are about 150 meters away. If the oncoming vehicle doesn't switch off their high beams, you can flash your high beams alternately to signal them. If the oncoming vehicle still doesn't switch off their high beams, slow down, move to the right, or stop to yield. When meeting on narrow roads, narrow bridges, or encountering non-motor vehicles, low beam headlights should be used. At night, when encountering at complex intersections or intersections with pedestrian crossings, low beam headlights should be used. When meeting at close range, it's crucial to be vigilant about the danger at the point where the lights of two vehicles intersect (the blind spot). Always pay attention to the movement of pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles to prevent pedestrians or non-motorized vehicles from crossing the road at the intersection. At night, overtaking should be avoided as much as possible. If overtaking is necessary, you should first switch between high and low beam headlights to signal the vehicle ahead. Only overtake after the vehicle ahead has yielded. If the vehicle ahead doesn't yield, overtaking forcefully is not allowed. When driving at night and you notice the lights of an approaching vehicle from behind getting closer, and the vehicle signals for overtaking, slow down and yield. If possible, move to the right side to give way. Do not yield blindly. When a vehicle breaks down at night, try to choose a safe area to park. Turn on the hazard lights, outline lights, and rear lights, and set up warning signs according to regulations. Passengers should move to a safe location and avoid staying inside the vehicle.

49: Driving at night: Crossing intersections and pedestrian crosswalks——When crossing well-lit intersections in urban areas at night, it's important to choose your lane in advance, reduce speed, and proceed according to traffic signals. When passing through poorly lit intersections at night, it's important to switch between high and low beams about 150 meters before the intersection to signal other vehicles and pedestrians, and proceed at a reduced speed. When turning at an intersection, it's advisable to switch from high to low beams and activate the turn signal about 30 to 100 meters before reaching the intersection. Slow down before entering the intersection, continuously adjust between high and low beams, ensuring safe passage. At night, when passing through a pedestrian crossing or an intersection without traffic signal control, you should slow down and approach slowly from about 100 meters away. Alternately using high and low beams to signal, stop, look around, and confirm safety before proceeding at a low speed. At the same time, be mindful of pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles in the darkness.

50: Driving at night: Through curves and slopes——When passing through relatively sharp curves at night, about 150 meters before the curve, alternate between high and low beams as a signal. When turning, switch off the high beams and switch on the low beams, reduce speed, keep to the right, and be prepared to stop at any time. When passing through a series of curves, continue to alternate between high and low beams as a signal, and pay attention to the end of the curve. Adjust the direction of travel as needed to ensure safety. When driving uphill at night, it's advisable to accelerate in advance to climb the slope. Alternate between high and low beams to signal and alert oncoming vehicles and pedestrians. As the vehicle approaches the crest of the slope, it's important to control the speed appropriately. Switch from high beams to low beams to prevent dazzling oncoming drivers, which could lead to loss of control of vehicles. When driving downhill, it's recommended to use high beams to increase visibility range.

51: Entering the highway: 1)Taking a toll card. When approaching a toll booth on the highway, adhere strictly to the speed limit. Choose a lane with a green light above and fewer vehicles, and queue up in order. Do not attempt to cut in line. At toll booths equipped with electronic toll collection (ETC) systems, use high and low beams to signal, stop, look around, and confirm safety before passing through at a low speed. At ETC toll booths, vehicles with electronic tags should maintain a certain distance from the preceding vehicle. Observe and select the ETC lane in advance. Vehicles can pass directly through the ETC lane without stopping at a speed of up to 20 kilometers per hour. When entering the toll booth, try to align the vehicle with the booth and stop when the driver's side window aligns with the toll window. After receiving the toll card at the entrance, store it properly for returning at the exit to pay the toll fee. 2)Entering the ramp. After passing through the toll booth, pay attention to the directional signs and markings. Choose the ramp that corresponds to your intended route. Upon entering the ramp, accelerate to an appropriate speed, but do not exceed the speed limit indicated by traffic signs. Remember: overtaking, making U-turns, stopping, and reversing are not allowed on the ramp. 3)Entering the driving lane. When driving a vehicle from the ramp into the acceleration lane, activate your left turn signal. Quickly accelerate to a speed of over 60 kilometers per hour. Carefully observe the traffic situation in the driving lane and choose the right time to merge. Emergency braking or stopping is not allowed in the acceleration lane. When merging from the acceleration lane into the driving lane, pay attention to the traffic in the driving lane. When there are fewer vehicles, merge from behind the normal traffic. If closely following normal traffic, control your speed and merge into the driving lane only after all vehicles have passed, without abruptly cutting in. Remember: do not directly enter the driving lane from the ramp, and do not obstruct the normal flow of traffic when merging from the acceleration lane into the driving lane.

52: Safe driving on highways: 1)Lane-specific speed limit driving. When driving on highways, it's essential to strictly adhere to the principle of 'stay in your lane and follow lane-specific speed limits.' Choose the appropriate lane according to your vehicle's speed and avoid crossing over lane markings or straddling lane dividers. Never occupy the emergency lane. In areas with speed limit signs, ensure that your vehicle's speed stays within the specified limit. 2)Maintaining a safe distance. On highways, there are specific sections designated to help drivers confirm the following distance between vehicles. These sections assist drivers in ensuring that the distance from the preceding vehicle is safe, especially when traveling at 100 kilometers per hour. When the speed exceeds 100 kilometers per hour, the distance from the preceding vehicle should be greater than 100 meters. When the speed is below 100 kilometers per hour, the distance from the preceding vehicle can be appropriately reduced, but it should not be less than 50 meters. Under normal circumstances, the longitudinal safe distance (in meters) on highways should be greater than the speed value (in kilometers per hour). 3)Lane changes. When driving on highways, frequent lane changes are not allowed. If you need to change lanes, observe the traffic conditions in the lane you intend to enter in advance. Only change lanes when it does not affect the normal driving of other vehicles and when it's safe to do so. Signal your intention with your turn signal, gradually steer into the new lane, and accelerate smoothly. When encountering obstacles, lane blockages, road construction, or damaged road sections ahead that require a lane change, pay attention to road signs or warning signs and follow their instructions. 4)Passing through tunnels. When approaching a tunnel on a highway, pay attention to traffic signs and information boards. About 50 meters before entering the tunnel, turn on your headlights, position lights, and taillights, and adjust your speed according to the speed limit signs. Pay close attention to traffic conditions inside the tunnel to avoid accidents or stalled vehicles due to breakdowns. Once inside the tunnel, focus on the distant road ahead and avoid looking at the tunnel walls on both sides to prevent dizziness. Maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead. Changing lanes, overtaking, and stopping randomly inside the tunnel are strictly prohibited. When exiting the tunnel, control your speed to prevent the vehicle from drifting due to crosswinds outside the tunnel mouth. Keep both hands firmly on the steering wheel. After exiting the tunnel, avoid accelerating blindly during the process of adjusting to the change in light conditions to avoid any potential danger.

53: Highway breakdown parking: When driving on highways, drivers should choose to park at service areas and must not stop in emergency lanes. If a vehicle breaks down and must stop, the driver should control the vehicle speed, observe traffic conditions ahead, behind, and to the right, activate the right turn signal, and quickly leave the travel lane, parking the vehicle on the emergency stopping lane or emergency lane. Emergency stopping is strictly prohibited, and parking within travel lanes is even more dangerous. After parking, immediately turn on the hazard warning flashers. At night, also turn on the position lights and taillights. Place a warning sign 150 meters behind the vehicle. Occupants should quickly move to a safe area outside the right front guardrail, facing oncoming traffic, and promptly call for assistance or report the incident to emergency services. If the vehicle is repaired within a short time and returns to the travel lane, the driver should increase the vehicle speed to above 60 kilometers per hour in the emergency lane, activate the left turn signal, and merge into the travel lane without impeding the normal flow of traffic.

54: Leaving the highway: (1)Entering the deceleration lane. Drivers should pay attention to observe exit advance signs. Generally, there are exit advance signs at 2 kilometers, 1 kilometer, and 500 meters before the exit. When you see the exit advance sign at 2 kilometers, gradually change lanes to the rightmost lane. When approaching the exit at 500 meters, activate the right turn signal, reduce speed appropriately, and smoothly enter the deceleration lane. (2)Entering the ramp. After entering the deceleration lane, the driver should turn off the right turn signal, pay attention to the speedometer, gradually decelerate, and enter the ramp. The speed must not exceed the speed indicated by the speed limit sign. Also, do not enter the ramp directly without using the deceleration lane. (3)Safe departure. Control the speed and pass through the toll booth. In the subsequent period, drivers may experience a deviation in speed judgment, known as 'speed illusion.' Therefore, do not rely solely on feelings to judge speed; always refer to the speedometer to accurately gauge speed and adapt to normal road driving.
